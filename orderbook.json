      "ai_reasoning": "After analyzing the provided data, I will output dynamic trading parameters based on the specific rules. Here are my findings:\n\n**Volatility:** Medium volatility (10-50%)\n**Volume:** Low volume (< $3k)\n**Buy/Sell Ratio:** 1.4 (balanced, with a slight leaning towards buying pressure)\n\n**Decisions:**\n\nGiven these parameters, I will apply the rules to determine the best course of action.\n\n1. **BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM**: The buy/sell ratio is 1.4, which indicates balanced trading activity. With recent trades showing 3 buys in both the last 5 and previous 5 trades, we can conclude that there is a slight momentum towards buying.\n2. **LIMIT ORDER (where to enter)**: Given medium volatility and low volume, I recommend entering near market prices with a limit of -2% to -5%. However, considering the balanced buy/sell ratio, I will err on the side of caution and choose a more conservative entry point.\n3. **TAKE PROFIT**: With low volume, it's essential to take profits early. I recommend setting a TP at +5% to +10%.\n4. **STOP LOSS**: Given medium volatility, we should set a SL at -8% to -15%.\n\nConsidering these parameters, here is the output:\n\n**DECISION:** WATCH\n\nReason: Balanced buy/sell ratio and recent trading activity suggest some buying momentum, but low volume indicates caution. It's essential to monitor price action before making an entry.\n\nIf you decide to trade, consider the following parameters:\n\nBUY | Limit:-3% | TP:+7% | SL:-10% | Time:2h",

Therefore, a take profit of +10% to +20%.\n\n4. **STOP LOSS**\n   - Medium volatility (+11%). Hence, a stop loss of -8% to -15%.\n\n5. **TIME FRAME**\n   - Since there's a strong trend and low volume, we can consider a longer time frame.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nGiven the analysis above, I recommend:\n\n**BUY | Limit:0% | TP:+15% | SL:-10% | Time:4h**\n\nThis is because of the strong buying pressure and stable momentum. The medium volatility doesn't require waiting for a bigger dip, so we can enter near the market. A take profit of +15% to +20% should be suitable given the medium volume.",
