The flow momentum is stable, which suggests a standard trading approach.\n\n**Parameters Explanation:**\n\n* Limit: Set at -3% to allow for some price correction before entering.\n* TP: Set at +12% to capture the upward movement while not being too aggressive due to medium volume and stable momentum.\n* SL: Set at -10% to provide sufficient room to breathe in case of a price drop.\n\n**WATCH or SKIP**\n\n* WATCH with reason: \"Balanced buy/sell ratio and stable flow momentum, but low trading activity (168 buys out of 300 trades). Consider waiting for stronger buying pressure or more significant price movement before entering.\"\n\nReasoning:\nWhile the token shows some buying interest, the overall trading activity is relatively low. A balanced buy/sell ratio indicates a neutral market sentiment, which may not be favorable for aggressive trading.\n\n**No SKIP**\n\n* The current price change of -13.2% and recent trades are not significantly bearish to warrant skipping this opportunity.",
