If you still want to enter the market, consider a more conservative approach with tighter stop-loss and take-profit parameters.\n\n**Dynamic Parameters:**\n\n1. **Limit Order:** Due to high volatility (price change > 50%), I recommend entering at -5% to -10%.\n2. **Take Profit:** With low volume, it's essential to take profit early. Set TP at +5% to +10%.\n3. **Stop Loss:** Given the low volume and high volatility, set SL at -8% to -12%. This will provide some room to breathe while minimizing losses.\n4. **Time Frame:** As there's a strong trend and low volume, consider a 2h to 6h time frame.\n\n**Final Parameters:**\n\nBUY | Limit:-7% | TP:+8% | SL:-10% | Time:3h",
