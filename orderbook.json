      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the data provided, I'll analyze the PlantGPT/SOL token and provide dynamic trading parameters.\n\n**BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM:**\n\n* Buy/Sell Ratio: 1.1 (slightly above balanced)\n* Recent trades: 3 buys in the last 5 trades\n* Flow momentum: STABLE\n\nGiven these factors, I would categorize this as a **WATCH** situation. While there is some buying pressure, it's not strong enough to consider an aggressive buy. The stable momentum suggests that the token is experiencing a period of equilibrium, but without more significant buying pressure or acceleration in momentum.\n\n**LIMIT ORDER (where to enter):**\n\n* Volume: $5,164 (medium volume)\n* Price Change: +14.7% ( medium volatility)\n\nConsidering these factors, I would recommend entering at a -3% limit order. This is because the token has experienced some price appreciation, but not enough to justify waiting for a bigger dip.\n\n**TAKE PROFIT:**\n\n* Volume: $5,164 (medium volume)\n\nGiven the medium volume and the recent price change, I would set the take profit target at +12%. This balance between potential profit and risk of selling too soon is suitable for this token's current market conditions.\n\n**STOP LOSS:**\n\n* Volume: $5,164 (medium volume)\n* Price Change: +14.7% ( medium volatility)\n\nFor a stop loss, I would recommend setting it at -9%. This provides some room to breathe while also limiting potential losses in case the token reverses direction.\n\n**TIME FRAME:**\n\n* Volume: $5,164 (medium volume)\n\nGiven the medium volume and stable momentum, I would suggest a time frame of 2 hours. This duration balances the need for quick trade with the potential for price stabilization.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\nWATCH\n\nReason: While there is some buying pressure and moderate volatility, the token's current market conditions do not justify an aggressive buy or immediate entry. A more cautious approach is warranted to manage risk.\n\nNo specific parameters are given since it's a WATCH recommendation; however, if you choose to enter the trade:\n\nBUY | Limit:-3% | TP:+12% | SL:-9% | Time:2h",
