      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the provided data and the rules outlined, here's the structured analysis and decision:\n\n### **Key Metrics & Rules Application**\n1. **Buy/Sell Ratio**:  \n   - The user specifies a **Buy/Sell Ratio of 0.8**, which is **less than 1.0**.  \n   - According to Rule 1, this indicates **high risk** (more sells than buys), suggesting the decision should be **WATCH** or **SKIP**.\n\n2. **Recent Trade Activity**:  \n   - Last 5 trades: **2 buys**.  \n   - Previous 5 trades: **4 buys**.  \n   - Overall, **147 buys vs. 153 sells** (ratio \u2248 0.96).  \n   - This suggests **slightly more sells**, but the recent trades show **buying pressure** in the short term.\n\n3. **Trade Flow & Momentum**:  \n   - Trade Flow is **stable** (no strong bullish or bearish bias).  \n   - Recent third (last 100 trades): **57 buys** (57% of trades).  \n   - Middle third: **49 buys** (49% of trades).  \n   - Early third: **57 buys** (57% of trades).  \n   - Overall, **buys slightly dominate**, but the ratio is still **close to 1.0**.\n\n4. **Price Change & Volatility**:  \n   - **+13.4% price change** \u2192 **medium volatility**.  \n   - Rule 2: **Limit order** = **-2% to -5%**.  \n   - Rule 3: **Take profit** = **+10% to +20%**.  \n   - Rule 4: **Stop loss** = **-8% to -15%**.  \n   - Rule 5: **Time frame** = **4 hours to 1 day**.\n\n---\n\n### **Decision**\nDespite the **Buy/Sell Ratio of 0.8** (indicating more sells), the **recent trades and Trade Flow** show **slightly stronger buying pressure** and **stable momentum**. However, the ratio is still **below 1.0**, which **increases risk**. \n\n**Final Decision**:  \n**WATCH**  \n- **Rationale**: The ratio is **below 1.0**, indicating **high risk**. While recent trades suggest some buying pressure, the overall imbalance favors **sells**, warranting caution.  \n- **Recommendation**: Monitor the market closely, and consider entering a trade only if the ratio improves (e.g., crosses above 1.0) or if the momentum shifts decisively to the bulls.  \n\n**Parameters (if proceeding)**:  \n- **Limit Order**: -2% to -5%  \n- **Take Profit**: +10% to +20%  \n- **Stop Loss**: -8% to -15%  \n- **Time Frame**: 4 hours to 1 day  \n\n**Note**: The discrepancy between the user's provided ratio (0.8) and the actual trade data (147 buys vs. 153 sells) may require further clarification. However, based on the given data, **WATCH** is the most conservative and risk-aware choice.",
