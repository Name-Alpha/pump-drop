The buy/sell ratio is 1.6, which suggests strong buying pressure.\n\n**Momentum Analysis:**\n\nThe trade flow momentum is STABLE, with a consistent ratio of buys to sells across the three-thirds of trades.\n\n**Dynamic Parameters:**\n\nBased on the rules provided:\n\n1. **BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM:**\n\t* The buy/sell ratio (1.6) indicates strong buying pressure.\n\t* With stable momentum and high volatility, we'll consider aggressive parameters.\n2. **LIMIT ORDER (where to enter):**\n\t* Given the recent price change (+15.9%) is above 50%, we'll use a -5% limit order to wait for a bigger dip.\n3. **TAKE PROFIT:**\n\t* With a volume of $5,361, which is below $10k, we'll aim for +10% to +15% take profit.\n4. **STOP LOSS:**\n\t* Considering the high volatility and stable momentum, we'll set a -10% to -12% stop loss.\n5. **TIME FRAME:**\n\t* Given the high volatility and strong buying pressure, we'll trade with a 30min to 1h time frame.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nBased on these dynamic parameters:\n\nBUY | Limit:-5% | TP:+12% | SL:-11% | Time:45m\n\nThe reason for this decision is that the Lupe token shows strong buying pressure and high volatility, indicating potential short-term gains. With stable momentum and a reasonable volume, we can consider an aggressive entry with a tight stop loss.\n\nNote: Always set your risk management according to your trading strategy and financial situation.
