Applying the rule for low volume: +5% to +10%.\n4. **STOP LOSS**: High volatility (> 50%) requires a larger stop loss range: -15% to -25%.\n5. **TIME FRAME**: Low volume and stable momentum suggest a longer time frame: 2h to 6h.\n\n**Dynamic Trading Parameters:**\n\nBUY | Limit:0% | TP:+7% | SL:-18% | Time:4h\n\nThe decision is based on the strong buying pressure, moderate volatility, low volume, and stable momentum. This setup allows for an aggressive entry with a relatively short stop loss while targeting a reasonable profit.\n\n**Reasoning:** Liminal token shows strong buying pressure, indicating potential uptrend. With moderate volatility, low volume, and stable momentum, we'll apply more conservative parameters to minimize risk.",
