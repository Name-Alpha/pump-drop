We will set our limit order to -3% from the current price.\n\n3. **TAKE PROFIT**\n\t* With a volume of $4,218, we can consider it as low volume (<$3k). Let's set our take profit at +7%.\n\n4. **STOP LOSS**\n\t* Since the volatility is medium, let's set our stop loss to -12% from the current price.\n\n5. **TIME FRAME**\n\t* Considering the stable momentum and low volume, a 2h time frame seems suitable for this trade.\n\n**Final Parameters:**\n\nBUY | Limit:-3% | TP:+7% | SL:-12% | Time:2h\n\n**Reason:** We are buying into Papua/SOL despite the strong selling pressure due to its relatively stable flow momentum. Our limit order is set 3% below the current price, and we will take profit at +7%. The stop loss is set at -12% to give room for a potential dip.\n\nPlease note that these parameters are specific to this token and should be adjusted based on future data.",
