The limit order is set at -3%, which is within the recommended range for low volume and high volatility. The take profit is set at +7%, which is slightly above the upper end of the recommended range for low volume. The stop loss is set at -14%, which provides some room to breathe in case the price drops.",

The momentum is stable, but there's a slight acceleration in buys over sells. Therefore, we can consider an aggressive entry.\n\n* BUY with Aggressive Parameters\n\n**Limit Order (where to enter):**\nGiven the recent price change of -22.2%, which is moderate, and considering the low volume, it's best to enter near market prices.\n\n* Limit: 0% (market order)\n\n**Take Profit:**\nWith a current volume of $3,798, we can consider a medium volume scenario.\n\n* TP: +10% to +20%\n\n**Stop Loss:**\nConsidering the moderate price change and low volatility, we can set a standard stop loss level.\n\n* SL: -8% to -15%\n\n**Time Frame:**\nGiven the stable momentum and moderate price change, a 2h to 6h time frame seems suitable for this trade.\n\nTherefore, here's the decision:\n\nBUY | Limit:0% | TP:+10%-20% | SL:-8%-15% | Time:4h\n\nNote that I've used a conservative range for the stop loss and take profit levels due to the moderate price change and low volume. If the momentum or price action changes, you may need to adjust these parameters accordingly.",
