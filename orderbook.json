The recent trades indicate minimal buying pressure, but not strong enough to trigger an aggressive BUY.\n\n**Limit Order**\n\n* Price Change: +22.7%\n* Volume: $1,699\n\nThis token has a relatively high price change, indicating some volatility. However, the volume is low, which suggests that there may be less liquidity to absorb a potential loss. Given these factors, I would recommend entering with a **-3% to -5%** limit order, waiting for a slight dip in price.\n\n**Take Profit**\n\n* Volume: $1,699\n\nGiven the low volume, it's essential to take profits early to avoid being stuck in a position with limited liquidity. I would set the Take Profit at **+10%**, taking advantage of any potential short-term gains while minimizing risk.\n\n**Stop Loss**\n\n* Price Change: +22.7%\n* Volume: $1,699\n\nConsidering the high price change and low volume, it's crucial to have a safety net in case the token's price drops rapidly. I would set the Stop Loss at **-12%**, allowing for some room to breathe while minimizing potential losses.\n\n**Time Frame**\n\n* Recent trades (300 total): 127 buys, 173 sells\n* Last 5 trades: 1 buy\n\nGiven the relatively low buying pressure and stable momentum, I would recommend a shorter time frame. However, considering the token's price change and volume, a **2h to 4h** time frame seems reasonable.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nBased on these dynamic parameters:\n\nWATCH | Limit:-3% | TP:+10% | SL:-12% | Time:2h",

      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the provided data, here are the dynamic trading parameters for JETBLUE / SOL:\n\n**Buy/Sell Pressure & Momentum:**\nThe buy/sell ratio is 0.9, indicating more sells than buys. This suggests **HIGH RISK**.\n\n**Trade Flow:**\nThe recent trades show a strong trend of buying (71% buys in the last third), but with stable momentum.\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven the high risk due to the buy/sell imbalance and stable momentum, I recommend **WATCH** for now.\n\nHowever, considering the strong buying pressure in the recent trades, let's review the other parameters:\n\n**Limit Order (where to enter):**\nMedium volatility (10-50% price change), but with a slight bias towards selling. Therefore, I suggest entering near market: **0%**\n\n**Take Profit:**\nLow volume ($3k-$10k) and stable momentum. Taking profit early seems reasonable: **+5% to +10%**\n\n**Stop Loss:**\nMedium volatility, so a moderate stop loss is suitable: **-8% to -12%** (considering the high risk)\n\n**Time Frame:**\nLow volume, but with a strong trend in buying pressure. A slightly longer time frame seems reasonable: **2h to 4h**\n\nGiven these parameters, here's the formatted output:\n\n**WATCH** due to high risk and stable momentum.\n\nHowever, if you're confident in your analysis and still want to enter the market, consider the following parameters:\nBUY | Limit:0% | TP:+7.5% | SL:-10% | Time:3h",
