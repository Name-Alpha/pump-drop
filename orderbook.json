The limit price is set at -2%, which is slightly more aggressive than the standard range due to the strong buying pressure. The take profit is set at +7%, which is a reasonable target given the low volume and medium volatility. The stop loss is set at -12%, which provides some room for the trade to breathe while still being cautious.\n\n**Recommendation**\n\nBased on these dynamic trading parameters, the recommended decision is:\n\nBUY | Limit:-2% | TP:+7% | SL:-12% | Time:4h\n\nThis suggests buying the token with a limit price of -2%, targeting a profit of +7%, and setting a stop loss at -12%.
