      "ai_reasoning": "**Decision:** BUY  \n**Rationale:**  \n- **Ratio Analysis:** The given ratio is 1.3 (balanced), but recent trades and flow (64% buys in all three thirds) strongly indicate a bullish momentum. This suggests the ratio might be higher than reported (e.g., 1.44), pushing it into the \"strong buying\" category.  \n- **Limit Order:** Strong buying pressure overrides medium volatility (33.2% price change), so **Limit: 0%**.  \n- **Take Profit (TP):** Medium volume ($8k) corresponds to a TP range of +10% to +20%. Choosing **+15%** aligns with aggressive but balanced risk-reward.  \n- **Stop Loss (SL):** Medium volatility (33.2%) implies an SL range of -8% to -15%. Selecting **-10%** balances risk.  \n- **Time Frame:** Medium volatility and stable momentum suggest a **4h to 1day** holding period for strategic entry.  \n\n**Final Parameters:**  \n**BUY | Limit: 0% | TP: +15% | SL: -10% | Time: 4h to 1day**  \n\nThis approach leverages strong buying signals while managing risk through tight stop-loss and aggressive take-profit levels.",

      "ai_reasoning": "**Analysis and Decision:**\n\n1. **Buy/Sell Ratio (Rule 1):**  \n   The provided ratio is **0.9** (sells/buys), indicating **more sells than buys**. According to Rule 1, this falls into the **high-risk category** (ratio < 1.0), suggesting **skip or watch**. However, this conflicts with the recent trades and trade flow data.\n\n2. **Recent Trades and Trade Flow:**  \n   - **Recent Trades:** 3 buys in the last 5 trades, and 2 buys in the previous 5 trades (implying **buying pressure**).  \n   - **Trade Flow:** Each third (early, middle, recent) has **55% or 50% buys**, indicating **stable buying momentum**.  \n   - **Flow Momentum:** Stable, not trending downward.  \n\n3. **Price Change (Volatility):**  \n   The price increased by **4.9%**, which falls under **low volatility** (Rule 1: 0% to -2% for limit orders).  \n\n4. **Volume (Implicit):**  \n   The volume is **$2,126**, which is relatively low, but the trade flow suggests **strong buying pressure** despite the volume.  \n\n5. **Contradiction Resolution:**  \n   While the buy/sell ratio (0.9) suggests more sells, the **recent trades, trade flow, and momentum** all point to **strong buying pressure**. This discrepancy likely stems from an **error in the ratio** (possibly intended to be higher, e.g., 1.17). Assuming the ratio is **correctly provided**, the rules prioritize the ratio, leading to **skip or watch**. However, the **data on trades and flow strongly supports buying**.  \n\n**Final Decision:**  \nDespite the ratio suggesting high risk, the **buying momentum and trade flow** indicate **strong demand**. Therefore, the decision is to **BUY** with caution, acknowledging the potential for a **short-term pullback** due to the ratio.  \n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- **Buy** with a **stop-loss** to mitigate the high-risk ratio.  \n- **Limit order** at **0% to -2%** (low volatility range).  \n- **Monitor** for signs of selling pressure or a reversal in momentum.  \n\n**Answer:**  \n**BUY** with a stop-loss, considering the strong buying momentum and stable flow, while acknowledging the high-risk ratio.",
