Therefore:\n\t* Limit Order: -3% to -5%\n3. **TAKE PROFIT**\n\t* Volume: $13,533 (low volume)\n\t* Low volume suggests taking profit early.\n\t* Take Profit: +5% to +10%\n4. **STOP LOSS**\n\t* Price Change: -31.5% (medium volatility)\n\t* Medium volatility indicates a stop loss between -8% and -15%.\n\t* Stop Loss: -10% to -12%\n5. **TIME FRAME**\n\t* Low volume: 2h to 6h\n\t* Time Frame: 3h\n\n**Recommendation**\n\nConsidering the above parameters, I recommend:\n\nWATCH | Reason: More sells than buys (ratio < 1.0), but stable momentum and low volume.\n\nThe token has a higher sell pressure, which could indicate a bearish trend. However, the stable momentum suggests that the market is not strongly trending in either direction. Therefore, it's best to WATCH the token for now rather than taking an aggressive position.",
