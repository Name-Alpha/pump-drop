This indicates that there is no significant acceleration or deceleration in buying pressure.\n\n**Volatility and Price Change:**\n\nThe price change is +26.7%, which falls into the medium volatility category (10-50%). The volume is $4,149, which is relatively low compared to other tokens.\n\n**Buy/Sell Ratio:**\n\nThe buy/sell ratio is 1.8, indicating strong buying pressure.\n\n**Dynamic Trading Parameters:**\n\nBased on the analysis above, here are the dynamic trading parameters for Oystar/SOL:\n\n1. **BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM:**\n\t* Strong buying pressure (ratio > 1.5): **BUY**\n2. **LIMIT ORDER (where to enter):**\n\t* Medium volatility (10-50%): -**3%** to -**5%** (wait for a dip, but not too deep)\n3. **TAKE PROFIT:**\n\t* Low volume (< $3k): +**8%** to +**12%** (take profit early due to low liquidity)\n4. **STOP LOSS:**\n\t* Medium volatility: -**10%** to -**15%** (standard stop loss range for medium volatility)\n5. **TIME FRAME:**\n\t* Low volume: 2h to 6h (longer time frame due to low liquidity)\n\n**Decision:**\n\nBased on the analysis above, I recommend:\n\n**BUY | Limit:-3% | TP:+8% | SL:-10% | Time:4h**\n\nThis decision takes into account the strong buying pressure, medium volatility, and low volume. The limit order is set at -3% to wait for a dip, while the take profit is set at +8% to +12% to exit early due to low liquidity. The stop loss is set at -10% to -15% as standard for medium volatility.",

However, since there are more sells than buys in the recent trades (4 buys out of 5), this can be considered a warning sign.\n\n**Flow momentum:** STABLE\n\nConsidering the stable momentum and strong buying pressure, I'll adjust the parameters accordingly:\n\n* Since the ratio is greater than 1.5, we will have an aggressive BUY.\n* However, to account for the recent sell trades, let's reduce the aggressiveness slightly.\n\n**Limit Order:**\nGiven the low volume ($555) and relatively stable momentum, we can enter near the market price.\n\n**Take Profit:**\nSince the volume is low, let's aim for a lower take profit to exit early.\n\n**Stop Loss:**\nConsidering the stable momentum but recent sell trades, we'll set a tighter stop loss to minimize potential losses.\n\n**Time Frame:**\nWith low volume and relatively stable momentum, a 2h time frame seems reasonable.\n\nBased on these parameters:\n\nBUY | Limit:0% | TP:+5% | SL:-8% | Time:2h\n\nI recommend BUYING with the specified parameters.",
