      "ai_reasoning": "**Decision:** WATCH\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe provided \"Buy/Sell Ratio\" of **0.7** (interpreted as **sells/buys**) indicates **more sells than buys**, which aligns with a **high-risk** condition under Rule 1. However, the **price has increased by +4.1%**, suggesting **buying pressure** or a **short-term upward trend**. This creates a **contradiction** between the ratio (indicating more sells) and the price movement (indicating buying pressure). Given the **stable trade flow** (middle third showing stronger buying) and the **medium volatility** (4.1% price change), the market is in a **neutral to cautious state**. Thus, **WATCH** is the safest decision to monitor further signals before committing to a trade.\n\n---\n\n**Dynamic Parameters:**  \n1. **Limit Order:**  \n   - **Range:** -2% to -5% (medium volatility).  \n   - **Reason:** Medium volatility requires a moderate stop-loss to balance risk and reward.  \n\n2. **Take Profit:**  \n   - **Range:** +5% to +10% (low volume).  \n   - **Reason:** Low volume suggests limited price movement, so a modest take profit is appropriate.  \n\n3. **Stop Loss:**  \n   - **Range:** -8% to -15% (medium volatility).  \n   - **Reason:** Medium volatility necessitates a wider stop-loss to avoid premature exits.  \n\n4. **Time Frame:**  \n   - **Range:** 2 hours to 6 hours (low volume).  \n   - **Reason:** Low volume implies slower price action, requiring a longer time horizon for confirmation.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the ratio suggests caution, the upward price movement and stable trade flow warrant a **WATCH** decision. Further analysis of volume, momentum, and market sentiment is recommended before entering a trade.",
