The ratio may be inaccurately reported, and the market activity aligns with aggressive buying.  \n\n---\n\n### **Parameters for BUY Decision:**\n\n1. **Limit Order (Low Volatility):**  \n   - **Range:** 0% to -2% (enter near market, as price change is +1.1% and volatility is low).  \n\n2. **Take Profit (Low Volume):**  \n   - **Range:** +5% to +10% (targeting short-term gains given low volume and stable momentum).  \n\n3. **Stop Loss (Low Volatility):**  \n   - **Range:** -5% to -8% (protecting against potential pullbacks in a low-volume environment).  \n\n4. **Time Frame:**  \n   - **Range:** 2 hours to 6 hours (short-term focus aligned with stable momentum and low volume).  \n\n---\n\n### **Key Considerations:**  \n- **Trade Flow:** Strong buying in the middle third (83 buys) indicates institutional or large-volume support.  \n- **Recent Activity:** Recent trades (3 buys in last 5) reinforce bullish sentiment.  \n- **Price Movement:** +1.1% suggests a minor uptrend, but volume remains low, so caution is warranted.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe market shows **aggressive buying pressure**, warranting a **BUY** decision with **aggressive parameters**. Monitor for volume spikes or price reversals to adjust strategy dynamically.",
