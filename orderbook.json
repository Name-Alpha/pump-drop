The recent trades show 3 buys in the last 5 trades, indicating an upward trend.\n\n**Buying Pressure**\n\nThe Buy/Sell Ratio is 1.7, which suggests strong buying pressure. According to Rule 1:\n\n* Since there are more sells than buys is not true, we do not have a ratio < 1.0.\n* The balanced ratio (1.0-1.5) does not apply here since it's above 1.5.\n* Strong buying pressure applies.\n\n**Limit Order**\n\nSince the price change is +25.8%, which is below 50%, and there are strong buying pressures, we use Rule 2:\n\n* Low volatility (< 10%) does not apply due to the price change.\n* Medium volatility (10-50%) also does not apply since it's above 50% but below 100%.\n* We will enter near market with a 0% limit order.\n\n**Take Profit**\n\nThe volume is $3,408, which falls into the low-to-medium volume category. According to Rule 3:\n\n* Since the volume is between $3k-$10k, we use +10% to +20%.\n\n**Stop Loss**\n\nGiven the stable momentum and low price change, we consider it a medium volatility situation. According to Rule 4:\n\n* Stop loss: -8% to -15%\n\n**Time Frame**\n\nWith strong buying pressure and consistent trade flow momentum, we can assume there's a trend in place. However, considering the volume is relatively low at $3,408, we use Rule 5 for low volume situations.\n\n* Time frame: 2h to 6h\n\n**Dynamic Parameters**\n\nGiven these analysis, I will output dynamic trading parameters:\n\nBUY | Limit:0% | TP:+15% | SL:-12% | Time:4h\n\nThis means you should buy the Alien token with a market order (0% limit), take profit at +15%, and set a stop loss at -12%. Hold for 4 hours.\n\n**Reason**: Strong buying pressure, stable momentum, and low volume warrant a conservative entry with a market order. Aiming to exit near the top of a possible trend.",
