      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the provided data, I will analyze each parameter dynamically and provide specific values for TutanLobs/SOL.\n\n**1. BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM**\n\n* Buy/Sell Ratio: 0.29 (232 sells vs 68 buys)\n* Momentum Flow: STABLE (14% buying pressure in recent third of trades)\n\nGiven the low buy/sell ratio, I will assign a **SKIP** status with a brief reason:\n\n`SKIP due to strong sell pressure`\n\nHowever, since we need to provide specific parameters for each token, let's continue analyzing other aspects.\n\n**2. LIMIT ORDER (where to enter)**\n\n* Price Change: -19.6% (Medium volatility)\n* Volume: $28,045 (Low volume)\n\nConsidering the medium volatility and low volume, I will set a limit order at:\n\n`-3%`\n\nThis allows for some room to breathe while entering near the market.\n\n**3. TAKE PROFIT**\n\n* Volume: $28,045 (Low volume)\n\nGiven the low volume, it's essential to take profit early. I will set a take profit range of:\n\n`+5% to +10%`\n\n**4. STOP LOSS**\n\n* Price Change: -19.6% (Medium volatility)\n* Volume: $28,045 (Low volume)\n\nFor medium volatility and low volume, I will set a stop loss at:\n\n`-8% to -12%`\n\nThis provides some room for error while minimizing losses.\n\n**5. TIME FRAME**\n\n* Volume: $28,045 (Low volume)\n\nGiven the low volume, it's best to use a longer time frame to avoid frequent entries and exits. I will set a time frame of:\n\n`2h to 4h`\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\nConsidering all parameters, I will recommend a **WATCH** status with brief reason:\n\n`WATCH due to strong sell pressure and low buying momentum`\n\nPlease note that this is a dynamic analysis based on the provided data, and you should continuously monitor the market for any changes in sentiment or volume.",

Since the price change is high, we can aim for a higher TP, but not too aggressive.\n* For Rule 4, given the high volatility and medium-high volume, our stop loss should be relatively tight at -12%.\n\n**Note:** With strong buying pressure and stable momentum, we enter with a standard approach. However, keep in mind that high volatility and price change suggest caution.\n\n**Alternative (if you prefer more aggressive parameters):**\n\nBUY | Limit:-2% | TP:+25% | SL:-10% | Time:1h\n\nThis is more aggressive, but still within the rules. Adjust according to your risk tolerance and trading style.\n\nAs the decision is based on specific token data, I would advise against applying these parameters to other tokens without re-evaluating their unique characteristics and market conditions.",

Entering at -1% will allow us to capture some of the upward movement while minimizing potential losses. A take profit of +18% will provide a good balance between risk and reward, considering the token's current price. The stop loss of -10% will help mitigate potential losses if the trend reverses.\n\nNote: These parameters are specific to this Solana token and may not be applicable to other tokens or market conditions.",
