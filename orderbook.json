      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the provided data, I'll analyze the token and provide dynamic trading parameters.\n\n**Token Analysis**\n\nThe Cooking/SOL token has a low current price of $0.00008695 and a relatively low volume of $18,382. The buy/sell ratio is 1.4, indicating a slight bias towards buying. The recent trades show 3 buys in the last 5 trades and 52% buys in each third of the trade flow.\n\n**Trading Parameters**\n\nBased on the rules, I'll provide dynamic trading parameters:\n\n1. **BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM**\n\t* Ratio: 1.4 (slightly biased towards buying)\n\t* Momentum: STABLE\n\t* Since momentum is stable and there's a slight bias towards buying, we can consider it as a standard parameter.\n2. **LIMIT ORDER**\n\t* Volume: Low ($18,382)\n\t* Price Change: -14.3% (medium volatility)\n\t* Based on the low volume and medium price change, we'll set the limit order to enter near the market.\n\n**Decision**\n\nGiven the stable momentum and a slight bias towards buying, I recommend:\n\nBUY | Limit:0% | TP:+10% | SL:-8% | Time:2h\n\nThis trade plan suggests entering at the current market price, aiming for a 10% take profit, and setting a stop loss of -8%. The time frame is set to 2 hours due to low volume.\n\n**Reasoning**\n\nThe token's stable momentum and slight bias towards buying make it a relatively safe trade. With a limit order of 0%, we're entering at the current market price, which should give us an optimal entry point. A take profit of +10% is reasonable given the medium volatility. Finally, a stop loss of -8% provides some room to breathe in case the token drops.\n\n**Note**\n\nPlease keep in mind that these parameters are dynamic and based on the specific data provided for this token. It's essential to continuously monitor the market and adjust trading parameters accordingly.",
