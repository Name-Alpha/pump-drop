      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the provided data, I'll analyze the Lupe token and determine dynamic trading parameters. Here's the analysis:\n\n**1. BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM:**\n\nThe buy/sell ratio is 2.2, indicating strong buying pressure. The flow momentum is STABLE, which suggests that the current trend is likely to continue.\n\nBased on these parameters, I recommend an aggressive entry strategy.\n\n**2. LIMIT ORDER (where to enter):**\n\nGiven the strong buying pressure and stable momentum, we can take a market order without waiting for a dip.\n\nLimit: 0% (market order)\n\n**3. TAKE PROFIT:**\n\nThe volume is $8,620, which falls into the medium volume category ($3k-$10k). This suggests that there's sufficient liquidity to exit the trade.\n\nTake Profit: +15%\n\n**4. STOP LOSS:**\n\nConsidering the stable momentum and strong buying pressure, we can set a relatively tight stop loss.\n\nStop Loss: -8%\n\n**5. TIME FRAME:**\n\nGiven the low volume ($8,620) and stable momentum, I recommend a time frame of 2h to 6h.\n\nTime Frame: 4h\n\n**Decision:**\n\nBased on these parameters, I recommend:\n\nBUY | Limit:0% | TP:+15% | SL:-8% | Time:4h\n\nThese values are based on the dynamic analysis of the Lupe token's data. Keep in mind that this is a specific recommendation for this particular token and market conditions may change over time.\n\n**Additional Note:** Given the recent trades (3 buys, 2 sells) and strong buying pressure, it seems that the trend is likely to continue upwards. However, always keep an eye on the charts and adjust your strategy accordingly.",
