However, the overall flow momentum is stable, indicating that the trend is not accelerating or decelerating rapidly.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nBased on the analysis, I recommend WATCH for this token. The buy/sell ratio is less than 1.0, indicating more sells than buys, which suggests high risk. Additionally, the stable flow momentum does not provide a strong indication of acceleration or deceleration.\n\n**Why WATCH?**\n\nThe price change is high (+77%), but the recent trades show only 2 buys out of the last 5 trades. This mixed signal indicates that caution should be exercised before entering a trade. The token may need to settle and correct its price before a more definitive trend emerges.\n\n**Dynamic Trading Parameters:**\n\nBased on the rules, here are the dynamic trading parameters:\n\n* Limit Order: -5% (wait for a bigger dip due to high volatility)\n* Take Profit: +10% (medium volume)\n* Stop Loss: -8% (medium volatility)\n* Time Frame: 2h (moderate time frame considering the stable momentum)\n\nNote that these parameters are subject to change as new data emerges and the situation evolves.",
