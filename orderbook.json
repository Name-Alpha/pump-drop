      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the data provided, here are the dynamic trading parameters for Tastecoin:\n\n**Momentum and Pressure:**\n\n* Buy/Sell Ratio: 3.4 (strong buying pressure)\n* Recent trades: 1 buy, 109 sells in the last 300 trades\n* Flow momentum: STABLE\n\nDecision: BUY\n\n**Buy Parameters:**\n\nBUY | Limit:0% | TP:+20% | SL:-8% | Time:2h\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Strong buying pressure indicates a high likelihood of price increase.\n* Stable momentum suggests that the token is in a steady state, allowing for an aggressive entry with a market order (limit 0%).\n* A take profit of +20% should be sufficient given the strong buying pressure and stable momentum.\n* A stop loss of -8% provides some room to breathe while still allowing for potential price appreciation.\n\n**Alternative Scenario:**\n\nIf we were to apply the rules strictly, with a Buy/Sell Ratio of 3.4 indicating strong buying pressure, we would enter at market order (limit 0%). However, considering the recent trade data and stable momentum, it's reasonable to assume that the token is in a steady state, making a limit entry feasible.\n\n**Trade Flow Analysis:**\n\nThe trade flow analysis suggests that Tastecoin has been experiencing strong buying pressure throughout its lifespan. The fact that the early third and middle thirds of trades show similar buy ratios (53% and 87%, respectively) indicates that this is not just a short-term trend, but rather a sustained phenomenon.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the data provided, it's reasonable to conclude that Tastecoin is experiencing strong buying pressure with stable momentum. This makes it a BUY candidate with the specified parameters.",

However, the buy/sell ratio indicates strong buying pressure. We will adjust our limit order accordingly:\n\n* **Limit Order:** -5% to -10% (wait for bigger dip)\n\n**RULE 3: TAKE PROFIT**\n\nThe volume is low (< $3k). Therefore, we will take profit early:\n\n* **Take Profit:** +5% to +10%\n\n**RULE 4: STOP LOSS**\n\nGiven the high volatility and strong buying pressure, we need to set a more cautious stop-loss:\n\n* **Stop Loss:** -15% to -25% (room to breathe)\n\n**RULE 5: TIME FRAME**\n\nConsidering the low volume and stable momentum, we will use a medium-term approach:\n\n* **Time Frame:** 2h\n\n**FINAL DECISION**\n\nBased on these parameters, I recommend:\n`WATCH` | Reason: Strong buying pressure with stable momentum, but high volatility indicates potential for price fluctuations.\n\nNote that if the momentum were to accelerate or decelerate significantly, we would need to reassess our approach and adjust the trading parameters accordingly.",
