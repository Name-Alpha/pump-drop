      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the provided data, I'll calculate dynamic trading parameters for the Onsing/SOL token.\n\n**Current Analysis:**\n\n* Volume is relatively low ($2,327), indicating a small market.\n* The buy/sell ratio is 1.1, which suggests balanced buying and selling pressure.\n* The recent trades show a mix of buys and sells, with a slight bias towards buying (2 buys in the last 5 trades).\n* The flow momentum is STABLE.\n\n**Parameter Calculations:**\n\n1. **BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM**\n\t* Buy/sell ratio: 1.1\n\t* Momentum: STABLE\n\t* Conclusion: Standard parameters are suitable.\n2. **LIMIT ORDER (where to enter)**\n\t* Price change: +6.9% (medium volatility)\n\t* Strong buying pressure: balanced buy/sell ratio, so we'll consider a market order with some buffer for safety.\n3. **TAKE PROFIT**\n\t* Volume: $2,327 (low volume)\n\t* Conclusion: Take profit early to avoid getting caught in potential reversals.\n4. **STOP LOSS**\n\t* Volatility: moderate (+6.9% price change)\n\t* Conclusion: Standard stop loss parameters are suitable.\n5. **TIME FRAME**\n\t* Volume: $2,327 (low volume)\n\t* Momentum: STABLE\n\t* Conclusion: A medium to short time frame is suitable.\n\n**Dynamic Trading Parameters:**\n\nBased on the calculations above, I recommend the following trading parameters:\n\n* **Decision:** BUY\n* **Limit:** -1% (market order with some buffer for safety)\n* **TP:** +5% (take profit early due to low volume and stable momentum)\n* **SL:** -8% (standard stop loss parameters for moderate volatility)\n* **Time:** 2h (medium time frame suitable for the given conditions)\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe token shows balanced buying and selling pressure, with a slight bias towards buying. The flow momentum is stable, indicating no significant trend reversals in the near future. Given the low volume and moderate price change, we'll enter at a market order with some buffer for safety. We'll take profit early to avoid getting caught in potential reversals, and use standard stop loss parameters.\n\nNote that these parameters are dynamic and based on the specific data provided. They may not be suitable for all trading situations or time frames. It's essential to continuously monitor the token's performance and adjust your strategy accordingly.",
