      "ai_reasoning": "**Analysis and Recommendation:**\n\n1. **Buy/Sell Ratio (0.7):**  \n   - The given ratio (0.7) is **less than 1**, indicating **more sells than buys** in the overall context.  \n   - According to Rule 1, this signals **high risk** and suggests **skipping or watching** the trade.\n\n2. **Price Change (+6.2%):**  \n   - This is a **moderate price increase**, falling into the **low volatility** category.  \n   - Rule 2 recommends a **limit order range of 0% to -2%** (enter near market) for low volatility.\n\n3. **Flow Momentum (STABLE):**  \n   - Stable momentum implies **no strong directional bias** in the recent trades.  \n   - This aligns with Rule 1\u2019s guidance to use **standard parameters** for stable momentum, but the ratio still suggests caution.\n\n4. **Recent Trades and Flow:**  \n   - The **last 5 trades** show **4 buys** (80% buying pressure), and **previous 5 trades** show **5 buys** (100% buying pressure).  \n   - While this indicates **strong buying pressure in recent short-term trades**, the **overall ratio of 0.7** (across 300 trades) still reflects **more sells than buys**.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nDespite the strong buying pressure in recent trades, the **overall buy/sell ratio of 0.7** (less than 1) and **stable momentum** suggest **moderate risk**. However, the **high risk** from the ratio and **low volatility** environment necessitate **caution**.  \n\n**Recommended Action:**  \n- **Watch** the trade closely.  \n- Use **limit orders near the current price (0% to -2%)** for low volatility.  \n- Monitor for any shifts in the **buy/sell ratio** or **momentum** to reassess risk.  \n\n**Final Answer:**  \n**Watch** the trade with a **limit order near the current price** and monitor for changes in the buy/sell ratio or momentum.",
