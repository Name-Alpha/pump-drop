The recent trades show a slight increase in buying pressure, with 2 buys in the last 5 trades and 3 buys in the previous 5 trades.\n\n**Trade Flow Analysis**\n\nThe trade flow analysis shows that the token has experienced stable momentum, with a consistent buying pressure throughout the 300-trades period.\n\n**Critical Rules Application**\n\n1. **BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM**\n\t* The buy/sell ratio is 1.5, indicating strong buying pressure.\n\t* Momentum is STABLE, which means standard parameters are suitable.\n2. **LIMIT ORDER (where to enter)**\n\t* Volatility is low (<10%), so we'll use the \"enter near market\" strategy.\n3. **TAKE PROFIT**\n\t* Volume is medium ($4,293), so we'll use the +10% to +20% range.\n4. **STOP LOSS**\n\t* Volatility is low, so we'll use the -5% to -8% range.\n5. **TIME FRAME**\n\t* Since volume is medium and volatility is low, a 2h time frame seems suitable.\n\n**Dynamic Trading Parameters**\n\nBased on these rules, here are the dynamic trading parameters for RALPH/SOL:\n\nBUY | Limit:0% | TP:+15% | SL:-6% | Time:2h\n\nThese parameters reflect strong buying pressure, stable momentum, and a medium volume, which warrants a standard entry strategy.\n\n**Decision**\n\nDECISION: BUY",
