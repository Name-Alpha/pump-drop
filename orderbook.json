Therefore, we will use the **0% limit**, entering near market price, with no waiting for a dip.\n\n**Take Profit (TP):**\n- Volume is $23,160, which falls into the medium volume category ($3k-$10k). \n- Given the stable momentum and strong buying pressure, we can aim for a higher take profit to capitalize on the uptrend.\n- TP: +15% to +20%\n\n**Stop Loss (SL):**\n- The price change is 31.5%, which indicates medium volatility. \n- Therefore, our stop loss should be slightly more conservative than usual for this level of volatility.\n- SL: -8% to -12%\n\n**Time Frame:**\n- With stable momentum and strong buying pressure, we can use a longer time frame to ride the trend.\n- Time: 4h to 6h\n\nConsidering these parameters, here is our recommendation:\n\nBUY | Limit:0% | TP:+17.5% | SL:-10% | Time:5h",

The 30min time frame allows for quick exit in case of further price drops.\n\nNote: These parameters are specific to TutanLobs/SOL and may not be applicable to other tokens or markets.",
