A limit order of -2% to -5% should be sufficient for this token.\n\n**TAKE PROFIT:**\n\n* Volume: $23,346 (low to medium volume)\n* Recent trades: 3 buys in the last 5 trades\n\nConsidering the low to medium volume and recent buying activity, I recommend a take profit of +10% to +15%.\n\n**STOP LOSS:**\n\n* Price change: -28.4% (medium volatility)\n\nA stop loss of -8% to -12% should provide sufficient room for the trade to recover in case of a downturn.\n\n**TIME FRAME:**\n\n* Volume: $23,346 (low to medium volume)\n* Recent trades: 3 buys in the last 5 trades\n\nConsidering the low to medium volume and recent buying activity, I recommend a time frame of 2h to 4h for this trade.\n\nHere's the dynamic trading plan:\n\nBUY | Limit:-3% | TP:+12% | SL:-10% | Time:3h\n\nThis trade plan balances risk and reward based on the specific data provided. The limit order is set at -3%, which is slightly below market, allowing for a small dip before entering. The take profit is set at +12%, providing a reasonable return given the low to medium volume and recent buying activity. The stop loss is set at -10%, providing sufficient room for the trade to recover in case of a downturn. The time frame is set at 3h, allowing for some flexibility in case the market moves quickly.\n\nIf you'd like me to adjust any of these parameters or provide additional analysis, please let me know!",
