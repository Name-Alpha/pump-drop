      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the provided data and applying the critical rules, here's a dynamic analysis of Papua/SOL:\n\n1. **BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM:**\n\t* Buy/Sell Ratio: 1.5 (balanced)\n\t* Recent trades: 3 buys in the last 5 trades\n\t* Flow momentum: STABLE\n\nGiven these conditions, we will consider a WATCH strategy due to balanced buying pressure and stable momentum.\n\n2. **LIMIT ORDER:**\n\t* Price Change: -46.7% (high volatility, but not extremely high)\n\t* Volume: $214,568 (medium volume)\n\nBased on the medium volume and considering the recent price drop might be an adjustment period rather than a long-term downturn due to the balanced buying/selling pressure, we will set our limit order at **-2.5%** below the current market price.\n\n3. **TAKE PROFIT:**\n\t* Volume: $214,568 (medium volume)\n\nFor medium volume and considering a standard approach, we'll aim for a **+10% to +15%** take profit. Given the current low price and volatility, aiming slightly higher than usual to capture any potential increase.\n\n4. **STOP LOSS:**\n\t* Price Change: -46.7%\n\t* Volume: $214,568\n\nConsidering the medium volume and the relatively significant drop in price (-46.7%), we should set a stop loss that allows for some room for correction without immediately exiting on a minor fluctuation. Therefore, a **-12% to -15%** stop loss seems reasonable.\n\n5. **TIME FRAME:**\n\t* Volume: $214,568\n\t* Flow momentum: STABLE\n\nGiven the stable flow momentum and medium volume, a standard time frame for this analysis is suitable. Thus, we will consider a **2h to 4h** time frame for monitoring and adjusting the trade.\n\nBased on these dynamic parameters:\n```\nWATCH | Limit:-2.5% | TP:+12.5% | SL:-13.25% | Time:3h\n```\n\nGiven the analysis above, the recommendation is to WATCH Papua/SOL with a limit order at -2.5%, aiming for a +12.5% take profit and setting a stop loss at -13.25%. The watch status indicates caution due to balanced buying/selling pressure but not enough indication of strong buying or selling momentum to either skip it entirely or jump in aggressively.",
