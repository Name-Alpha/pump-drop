BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM:**\n\n* Buy/Sell Ratio: 0.9 (less than 1.0)\n* Flow momentum: STABLE\n* Recent trades: 2 buys in last 5 trades, indicating some buying pressure\n\nParameters:\n* Given the low buy/sell ratio and stable momentum, this is a high-risk trade. I will recommend WATCH.\n\n**WATCH** due to unbalanced buy/sell ratio and lack of strong buying pressure.\n\n**No specific trading parameters are provided for BUY or SKIP, as per the decision above**\n\nHowever, if we assume that the recent trend of 2 buys in last 5 trades continues, we might consider a conservative approach:\n\nBUY | Limit: -0.1% (enter near market) | TP: +10% (take profit early due to low volume) | SL: -5% (standard stop loss for low volatility)\n\nPlease note that this is an assumption and not the primary recommendation.\n\n**2. LIMIT ORDER (where to enter):**\n\n* Price change: +11.1% (moderate volatility)\n* Volume: $3,851 (low volume)\n* Buy/Sell Ratio: 0.9 (unbalanced ratio)\n\nParameters:\n* Limit Order: -1% to -2% (enter near market due to low volatility and unbalanced buy/sell ratio)\n\nBUY | Limit:-1% | TP:+5% | SL:-5%\n\n**3.

STOP LOSS:**\n\n* Volume: $3,851 (low volume)\n* Buy/Sell Ratio: 0.9 (unbalanced ratio)\n\nParameters:\n* Stop Loss: -5% to -8% (standard stop loss for low volatility and unbalanced buy/sell ratio)\n\nBUY | Limit:-1% | TP:+7% | SL:-6%\n\n**5. TIME FRAME:**\n\n* Volume: $3,851 (low volume)\n* Buy/Sell Ratio: 0.9 (unbalanced ratio)\n\nParameters:\n* Time Frame: 2h to 6h (wait for more data due to low volume and unbalanced buy/sell ratio)\n\nBUY | Limit:-1% | TP:+7% | SL:-6% | Time:4h\n\nNote that these parameters are based on the provided data and might not be suitable for all traders. It's essential to consider your own risk tolerance, market analysis, and trading goals before making any investment decisions.\n\n**Recommendation:** WATCH due to unbalanced buy/sell ratio and lack of strong buying pressure.",
