Therefore, we can use a standard limit order range of:\n\t\t+ 0% to -2%\n\n3. **TAKE PROFIT:**\n\t* Volume is $4,227, which falls in the medium volume category.\n\t* Therefore, a take profit range of +10% to +20% seems reasonable.\n\n4. **STOP LOSS:**\n\t* Volatility is relatively low (< 10% price change). Therefore, a standard stop loss range of:\n\t\t+ -5% to -8%\n\n5. **TIME FRAME:**\n\t* With stable momentum and strong buying pressure, we can consider a longer time frame to ride the trend.\n\t* A time frame of 4h to 1day seems suitable.\n\n**DECISION:**\n\nConsidering all the factors above, I would recommend:\n\nBUY | Limit:-0% | TP:+15% | SL:-6% | Time:5h\n\nThis decision is based on the strong buying pressure and stable momentum, indicating a potential uptrend. The limit order range of 0% to -2% allows for an entry near the market price. A take profit range of +10% to +20% is reasonable given the medium volume, and a stop loss range of -5% to -8% provides room for error. The time frame of 5h should give enough time to ride the trend.\n\n**RISK WARNING:** As with any trading decision, there's always some level of risk involved.
