This suggests that momentum might be accelerating.\n\n* BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM: WATCH with caution due to slight imbalance\n\n**2.

However, considering the recent trend, we'll analyze further.\n2. **MOMENTUM**: The flow momentum is STABLE, which suggests that the buying and selling pressure has been consistent over time.\n3. **LIMIT ORDER**:\nGiven the medium volatility (price change > 10%, < 50%), I recommend a limit order of -2% to -5%.\n\n4. **TAKE PROFIT**:\nConsidering the low volume (< $3k), we'll take profit early. I suggest a take profit range of +5% to +10%.\n5. **STOP LOSS**:\nFor medium volatility, a stop loss of -8% to -15% is recommended.\n6. **TIME FRAME**:\nGiven the stable momentum and medium volatility, a time frame of 2h to 4h seems suitable.\n\n**Decision**:\n\nBUY | Limit:-3% | TP:+7% | SL:-12% | Time:3h\n\nThe buy decision is based on the recent trend, despite the high risk due to more sells than buys.
