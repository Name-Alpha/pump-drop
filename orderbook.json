Moderate volume ensures enough liquidity to exit at a reasonable take profit level. A tight stop loss of -5% minimizes potential losses in case of an adverse move.",

A stop loss of -10% will provide some room to breathe in case the trend reverses.\n\n**Additional Considerations**\n\n* Volume: $14,249 is relatively low, so we won't adjust our time frame.\n* Price Change: +22.8% is moderate, not indicating extremely high volatility.\n\nOverall, I recommend a BUY with the specified parameters based on the token's strong buying pressure and stable momentum.",
