BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM:**\n\nBuy/Sell Ratio: 0.8\nFlow momentum: STABLE\n\nSince the buy/sell ratio is below 1.0 (more sells than buys), I'll classify this as a high-risk trade and suggest a **WATCH** approach.\n\n**2. LIMIT ORDER (where to enter):**\n\nPrice Change: -2.5% (low volatility)\nVolume: $4,405 (medium volume)\n\nConsidering the price change is relatively low (-2.5%) and the volume is moderate ($4,405), I recommend entering near the market with a **0%** limit order.\n\n**3. TAKE PROFIT:**\n\nVolume: $4,405 (medium volume)\nRecent trades: 133 buys, 167 sells\n\nGiven the medium volume and recent trade history (more sells than buys), I suggest taking profit at **+10% to +15%** to capitalize on potential buying pressure.\n\n**4. STOP LOSS:**\n\nPrice Change: -2.5% (low volatility)\nVolume: $4,405 (medium volume)\n\nFor low-volatility trades like this one, I recommend setting a stop loss at **-8% to -10%** to limit potential losses.\n\n**5. TIME FRAME:**\n\nSince the flow momentum is stable and there's no strong trend or high volatility, I suggest a medium time frame of **4h to 1day** for this trade.\n\nBased on these dynamic parameters:\n\n**Decision:** WATCH\n**Reason:** High-risk trade with more sells than buys (buy/sell ratio below 1.0) and moderate volume.\n\nPlease note that these parameters are specific to the WOW/SOL token based on the provided data.",
