The recent trades show a trend of increasing buys (5 in the last 5 trades). The Flow momentum is STABLE, which means we can consider standard parameters for this token.\n\n**LIMIT ORDER (where to enter):**\nThe price change is +11.7%, indicating moderate volatility (between 10-50%). Therefore, I recommend entering at -2% limit, allowing us to catch the trend while minimizing risk.\n\n**TAKE PROFIT:**\nWith a volume of $24,555, this is considered medium volume. Therefore, I suggest taking profit between +10% to +20%.\n\n**STOP LOSS:**\nThe token has moderate volatility, so I recommend setting a stop loss at -8% to -15%. This will allow us to limit our risk while capturing potential gains.\n\n**TIME FRAME:**\nGiven the moderate volatility and strong buying pressure, I suggest using a 2h to 4h time frame for this trade. This will enable us to capture the trend while minimizing exposure to larger market fluctuations.\n\n**Decision:**\nBased on these parameters, I recommend:\n\nBUY | Limit:-2% | TP:+15% | SL:-12% | Time:3h\n\nThis trade strategy is based on dynamic parameters tailored to the specific data of the Solana token \"bosh\".",

Strong buying pressure suggests entering near market price. Low volume requires taking profit early, and tight stop loss is suitable for low volatility.\n\nSince I am unable to provide a \"BUY\" format due to the cautious analysis above, I will not output specific dynamic parameters.
