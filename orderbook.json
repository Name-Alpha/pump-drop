However, since the volume is not extremely high, we will set a slight downward adjustment to accommodate potential price movements.\n3. **TAKE PROFIT:**\n\t* With medium volume, we will aim for a moderate take profit target of +10% to +15%.\n4. **STOP LOSS:**\n\t* Considering the moderate volatility and stable momentum, we can set a relatively tight stop loss range of -8% to -12%.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nBased on these parameters, I recommend a **BUY** entry:\n\nBUY | Limit:-2% | TP:+12% | SL:-10% | Time:2h\n\nThis decision is based on the following reasoning:\n\n* We are entering near the current price with a slight downward adjustment to accommodate potential price movements.\n* Our take profit target is set at +12%, which falls within our moderate range of +10% to +15%.\n* The stop loss range of -10% to -12% provides sufficient room for price movement while minimizing potential losses.\n\n**Reasoning:** This trade plan balances the need for aggressive entry with a reasonable risk-reward ratio, considering the stable momentum and moderate volatility.",

This suggests that we can consider a conservative approach.\n\n**Dynamic Trading Parameters for PlantGPT/SOL:**\n\n1. **BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM:**\n   - Since the Buy/Sell Ratio is above 1.0 and flow momentum is STABLE, we will use standard parameters.\n2. **LIMIT ORDER (where to enter):**\n   - Considering the price change of -3.7% is within medium volatility range (10-50%), we'll aim for a slightly higher dip than normal conditions but still reasonable given recent trades.\n3. **TAKE PROFIT:**\n   - With a volume of $10,070, which falls into high volume (> $10k), we can aim for a larger profit margin to exit the trade.\n4. **STOP LOSS:**\n   - Given medium volatility (-3.7%), our stop loss should be slightly above normal conditions.\n\n**Final Decision and Parameters:**\n\nBUY | Limit:-2% | TP:+30% | SL:-12% | Time:4h\n\nThis decision is based on a conservative approach, given the slightly positive buy pressure and stable momentum. Entering at -2% allows for some room to account for potential further dips while also being near current price levels, which can often be more profitable than entering very low or high.\n\n**Reasoning behind specific parameters:**\n\n- **Limit:** -2% is chosen because it's within the medium volatility range and slightly below average entry points in balanced conditions.\n- **Take Profit (TP):** +30% is selected for higher liquidity, allowing a larger profit margin to exit the trade with ease.\n- **Stop Loss (SL):** -12% provides room for a small dip without being too aggressive given current market conditions.\n- **Time Frame:** 4h allows us to capture potential longer-term trends while still giving sufficient time for momentum and price movement analysis.",
