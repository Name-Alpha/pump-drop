We will enter at market price and set a moderate take-profit level to capture some gains while avoiding over-exposure.\n\n**Notes:** As the token is relatively new and has low volume, it's essential to monitor the situation closely and adjust parameters accordingly. The analysis above should not be considered as investment advice.",

Entering at -3% below the current price allows for some room to breathe while still taking advantage of the upward trend. Taking profit at +7% provides a reasonable return while limiting potential losses with a stop loss of -12%. The time frame of 4h is chosen to allow the trade to play out without being overly aggressive.\n\n**WATCH or SKIP**\n\nBased on the analysis, I recommend WATCHing this token for now, as the price movement is relatively stable and not extremely high-risk. However, if the momentum continues to accelerate, the buy parameters may become more aggressive.",
