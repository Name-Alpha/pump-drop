      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the provided data and rules, here are the dynamic trading parameters for RRCH/SOL:\n\n**Buy Parameters:**\n\n* Buy pressure is strong, with 171 buys out of 300 trades (57.0% buy ratio). This is considered a \"strong buying\" situation.\n* Momentum is stable, which suggests a standard approach.\n\nGiven these conditions, I recommend:\n\nBUY | Limit:-1% | TP:+15% | SL:-8% | Time:4h\n\nThe reasoning behind this recommendation is as follows:\n- The strong buy pressure and high liquidity (171 buys out of 300 trades) indicate a significant buying momentum. This warrants an aggressive entry with a limit order close to the market price.\n- A take profit of +15% is reasonable, considering the token's volatility and potential for further growth.\n- A stop loss of -8% provides some room for error and accounts for possible price fluctuations.\n\n**Volume and Liquidity:**\nThe volume is relatively low at $12,369. However, since we are dealing with a strong buying pressure, we can enter near the market price without waiting for a bigger dip.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGiven the analysis, the recommended decision for RRCH/SOL is:\n\nBUY | Limit:-1% | TP:+15% | SL:-8% | Time:4h",

The flow momentum is STABLE, and the recent trades show an acceleration in buying activity (3 buys out of the last 5 trades). This suggests that the token has a significant upward trend.\n\n**Decision:** BUY\n\n**Limit Order:**\nThe price change is -8.5%, which falls under low volatility (<10%). Given the strong buying pressure, we'll enter with a market order to capitalize on the momentum.\n\n**Entry Parameters:**\nBUY | Limit:0% | TP:+10% | SL:-5% | Time:2h\n\n* We're entering at market price to avoid losing out on potential gains due to time or volatility.\n* A 10% take-profit target allows us to capitalize on the strong buying pressure and stable momentum, while also providing a reasonable reward-risk ratio.\n* A -5% stop-loss is relatively tight but justified by the low volatility and accelerating buying activity.\n\n**Volume:**\nThe volume of $2,619 is considered low. We'll adjust our parameters accordingly:\n\n**Take Profit:**\n+10% (as previously mentioned)\n\n**Stop Loss:**\n-5% (as previously mentioned)\n\nConsidering these factors, the final decision for Fartpin/SOL is:\n\nBUY | Limit:0% | TP:+10% | SL:-5% | Time:2h\n\nThis trade plan is based on the specific data provided and takes into account the token's unique characteristics.
