With strong buying pressure, we can enter at market price without waiting for a dip. A moderate take profit of +20% is set to capture potential gains while minimizing losses.\n\nNote: As the token's price change is -5.2%, it's considered low volatility. However, with stable flow momentum and accelerating buying momentum, we're confident in entering the trade with standard parameters.",
