      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the provided data, I will analyze the token and provide dynamic trading parameters.\n\n**Token Analysis**\n\n* Current Price: $0.00017746\n* Volume: $2,095\n* Buy/Sell Ratio: 1.38 (174 buys / 126 sells)\n* Recent trades (last 5): 3 buys, indicating a slight increase in buying pressure\n\n**Trading Parameters**\n\nBased on the rules provided:\n\n1. **BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM**\n\t* Since the buy/sell ratio is above 1.0 and relatively high at 1.38, we can consider this as strong buying pressure.\n\t* The flow momentum is STABLE, indicating no significant changes in buying or selling pressure.\n2. **LIMIT ORDER (where to enter)**\n\t* With a medium volume of $2,095, the price change of -1.8% falls within the 10-50% range, which suggests using a limit order with a more conservative entry point.\n3. **TAKE PROFIT**\n\t* The volume is relatively low ($2,095), so we should take profit early to avoid holding onto the trade for too long.\n4. **STOP LOSS**\n\t* Given the stable momentum and medium volatility, we can use standard stop loss parameters.\n\n**Decision**\n\nBased on these considerations, I recommend:\n\n**BUY | Limit:-3% | TP:+10% | SL:-5% | Time:2h**\n\nRationale:\nWe will enter at a 3% discount to the current price (limit order) and set our take profit at 10% above the entry point. Our stop loss will be placed at -5%, allowing for some room to breathe in case of an unexpected downturn.\n\nThis trade plan aims to capture some of the potential upside while minimizing losses if the momentum reverses.",
