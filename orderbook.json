      "ai_reasoning": "**Decision:** BUY  \n**Parameters:**  \n\n1. **Limit Order:**  \n   - **Range:** 0% to -2%  \n   - **Rationale:** The price change of +9.7% falls into the **low volatility** category (since it is just below 10%). For low volatility, the limit order is set between **0% to -2%**. However, since the Buy/Sell ratio is **1.4** (balanced), the limit order is adjusted to **0% to -2%** to reflect the balanced market condition.  \n\n2. **Take Profit:**  \n   - **Range:** +20% to +40%  \n   - **Rationale:** The volume of **$63,527** is considered **high volume** (> $10k), so the take profit range is set between **+20% to +40%**.  \n\n3. **Stop Loss:**  \n   - **Range:** -5% to -8%  \n   - **Rationale:** The price change of +9.7% is classified as **low volatility** (<10%), so the stop loss is set between **-5% to -8%**.  \n\n4. **Time Frame:**  \n   - **Range:** 30 minutes to 2 hours  \n   - **Rationale:** The volume is **high**, so the time frame is set to **30 minutes to 2 hours** for quick trades.  \n\n**Summary:**  \nThe balanced Buy/Sell ratio (1.4) and low volatility (9.7% price change) suggest a conservative BUY strategy. The high volume further supports aggressive take profit targets and tighter stop-loss ranges. The time frame is optimized for short-term execution.  \n\n**Final Answer:**  \nBUY with a limit order of **0% to -2%**, take profit of **+20% to +40%**, stop loss of **-5% to -8%**, and a time frame of **30 minutes to 2 hours**.",
