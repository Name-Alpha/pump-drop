This aligns with a **high-risk** scenario under Rule 1, as it suggests bearish sentiment or short-term selling pressure.\n\n2. **Price Change:**  \n   - The price increased by **+34.9%**, which falls into the **medium volatility** category. This suggests a **strong upward trend**, but the ratio does not reflect this, creating a potential discrepancy.\n\n3. **Recent Trade Activity:**  \n   - The last 5 trades show **3 buys**, and the previous 5 show **1 buy**, indicating a **slight bullish bias** in recent activity. However, this is not enough to override the overall ratio.\n\n4. **Flow Momentum:**  \n   - The trade flow is **stable**, with no clear trend in buying or selling pressure across the three segments. This reinforces the high-risk classification.\n\n5. **Limit Order (Rule 2):**  \n   - Medium volatility (34.9% price change) \u2192 **-2% to -5%** as the limit order range.\n\n6. **Take Profit (Rule 3):**  \n   - High volume ($10,269) \u2192 **+20% to +40%** as the take-profit range.\n\n7. **Stop Loss (Rule 4):**  \n   - High volume \u2192 **-15% to -25%** as the stop-loss range.\n\n8. **Time Frame (Rule 5):**  \n   - High volume and stable momentum \u2192 **30-minute to 2-hour** time frame for monitoring.\n\n---\n\n**Final Decision:**  \n**WATCH**  \n- **Reason:** The Buy/Sell ratio (0.4) indicates more sells than buys, signaling high risk. Despite the strong price increase, the ratio and recent trade activity suggest caution.  \n- **Action Plan:**  \n  - **Limit Order:** -2% to -5%  \n  - **Take Profit:** +20% to +40%  \n  - **Stop Loss:** -15% to -25%  \n  - **Time Frame:** 30-minute to 2-hour  \n\n**Note:** If the ratio was intended to reflect **buys/sells = 2.5** (sells/buys = 0.4), the decision would shift to **BUY** with aggressive parameters. However, based on the given data, **WATCH** is the appropriate choice.",
