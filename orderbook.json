      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the provided data, I will analyze the Solana token JOY and provide dynamic trading parameters.\n\n**Momentum Analysis:**\nThe buy/sell ratio is 0.7 (142 buys vs 158 sells), indicating a slight bias towards selling pressure. The recent trades show no buys in the last 5 trades and only 4 buys in the previous 5 trades, further supporting this assessment.\n\n**Trade Flow Momentum:** STABLE\n\nGiven the stable momentum and sell-pressure, I will set conservative parameters.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n1. **BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM:**\n\t* BUY/Sell Ratio: 0.7 (below 1.0) - indicates selling pressure\n\t* Momentum: STABLE - no significant acceleration or deceleration\n2. **LIMIT ORDER (where to enter):**\n\t* Volume: $1,960 (low volume)\n\t* Price Change: -8.2% (medium volatility)\n\t* Recent trades: 4 buys in previous 5 trades (some buying pressure)\n\t* Recommended limit: -3% to -5%\n3. **TAKE PROFIT:**\n\t* Volume: $1,960 (low volume)\n\t* Recommended TP: +5% to +10%\n4. **STOP LOSS:**\n\t* Volatility: medium (-8.2%)\n\t* Recommended SL: -8% to -15%\n5. **TIME FRAME:**\n\t* Low volume and stable momentum\n\t* Recommended time frame: 2h to 6h\n\n**Decision:** WATCH (due to selling pressure and low volume)\n\nReason: The token is experiencing selling pressure, with a buy/sell ratio of 0.7. Additionally, the recent trades show no significant buying activity. Given these factors, it's recommended to watch the market before entering a position.\n\nNote that these parameters are dynamic and based on specific data points for this particular token (JOY). They may change as new data becomes available.",

The take profit is set at +7%, considering the moderate volatility and low-medium volume. The stop loss is set at -10% to allow for some room to breathe.\n\n**Reasoning**\nThe token has strong buying pressure, but the recent trades are balanced, indicating a stable momentum. The price change is moderate, suggesting that there's room to grow without extreme volatility. With these parameters, we can take advantage of the strong buying pressure while managing risks with a reasonable stop loss and take profit levels.\n\n**Note**\nThese parameters are specific to this token and may not be applicable to other tokens with different market conditions.",
