      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the data provided for the AliensLove/SOL token, here are the dynamic trading parameters:\n\n**MOMENTUM & PRESSURE:**\nGiven a BUY/SELL ratio of 2.0, which is strong buying pressure, we'll apply aggressive parameters.\n\n* ACCELERATING momentum with stable flow: more aggressive entry (no limit order)\n\n**LIMIT ORDER:**\nThe price change is +11.6%, indicating medium volatility.\nHowever, given the strong buying pressure and accelerating momentum, we'll enter at market (0% to -2%).\n\n**TAKE PROFIT:**\nWith a volume of $17,109, which is low-medium volume, we'll aim for a take profit range of +5% to +10%.\n\n**STOP LOSS:**\nConsidering medium volatility and low-medium volume, the stop loss should be relatively tight. We'll set it at -8% to -12%.\n\n**TIME FRAME:**\nGiven the strong trend and accelerating momentum, we'll use a longer time frame to ride the trend. Let's choose 4h.\n\n**FINAL PARAMETERS:**\n\nBUY | Limit:0% | TP:+7% | SL:-10% | Time:4h\n\nReasoning:\nThe token has shown strong buying pressure with a high ratio of buys to sells, indicating an uptrend. With accelerating momentum and stable flow, we can enter aggressively at market price. Aiming for a take profit range of +5% to +7% should be sufficient given the low-medium volume. Finally, setting a stop loss at -10% will give us some room to breathe while allowing us to cut losses if the trend reverses.\n\nNote: These parameters are specific to the AliensLove/SOL token based on the provided data and may not be suitable for other tokens or market conditions.",

A stop loss of -12% provides some room for error.\n\n**Reasoning**\n\nThis token has shown strong buying pressure with a stable flow momentum. While there's no accelerating trend, the stable momentum suggests that the current uptrend may continue. With a low volume and medium volatility, we should be cautious but not too aggressive.
