However, the flow momentum is STABLE, which suggests that the buying and selling pressure are relatively balanced in the recent trades.\n\n**Recommendation:** WATCH (due to more sells than buys)\n\nHowever, considering the specific rules for each token:\n\n* Buying Pressure & Momentum: If more sells than buys (ratio < 1.0): SKIP or WATCH\n* Flow momentum is STABLE\n\nSince the flow momentum is stable and not accelerating or decelerating, we can consider a watch approach to monitor further price movements.\n\n**Parameters**\n\nFor this specific token, I will apply the following dynamic parameters:\n\n* BUY/SELL PRESSURE: WATCH (due to more sells than buys)\n* LIMIT ORDER: -2% to -5% (medium volatility)\n* TAKE PROFIT: +10% to +20% (medium volume)\n* STOP LOSS: -8% to -15% (medium volatility)\n* TIME FRAME: 4h to 1day (strong trend, low volume)\n\nPlease note that these parameters are based on the specific data provided for the Alto token and may not be suitable for other tokens or situations.\n\n**Final Decision:** WATCH\n\nReason: More sells than buys, stable flow momentum, and medium volatility.
