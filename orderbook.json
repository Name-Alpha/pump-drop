However, recent trades (168 buys vs. 132 sells) and the last 5 trades (4 buys) indicate **strong buying pressure**, pushing the decision toward **BUY** with conservative parameters.  \n\n2. **Limit Order:**  \n   - **Medium volatility** (18% price change) typically uses a range of **-2% to -5%**. Given the **strong buying momentum**, the limit is set at **-3%** to balance risk and opportunity.  \n\n3. **Take Profit:**  \n   - **Low volume** ($1,885) suggests **+5% to +10%** as the profit target. A **+8%** target is chosen to capitalize on the upward trend without overexposure.  \n\n4. **Stop Loss:**  \n   - **Low volume** and **medium volatility** imply a **-5% to -8%** stop loss range. A **-7%** stop loss is selected to protect capital while allowing for short-term fluctuations.  \n\n5. **Time Frame:**  \n   - **Low volume** and **stable momentum** suggest a **2h to 6h** time frame. A **4h** timeframe balances short-term execution with flexibility for market dynamics.  \n\n**Final Answer:**  \nBUY | Limit:-3% | TP:+8% | SL:-7% | Time:4h",

      "ai_reasoning": "**Analysis and Decision:**\n\n1. **Trade Ratio:**  \n   The recent trades show **174 buys** and **126 sells**, resulting in a **buys/sells ratio of ~1.38**, which falls within the **balanced range (1.0\u20131.5)**. This suggests a **moderate buying pressure**, aligning with the **\"balanced\"** category in Rule 1. However, the **sells/buys ratio of 0.7** (as stated in the data) also indicates **more buys than sells**, reinforcing the **buying pressure**. This places the trade in the **\"balanced\"** or **\"strong buying\"** category depending on the ratio interpretation. For simplicity, we'll treat it as **\"balanced\"**.\n\n2. **Price Change:**  \n   A **+11.6% price change** indicates **medium volatility**. According to Rule 2, this corresponds to a **limit order of -2% to -5%**. However, the **recent buying activity** and **positive price movement** suggest **strong buying pressure**, which overrides Rule 2 and recommends a **market order (0%)**.\n\n3. **Take Profit:**  \n   The **low volume ($1,157)** falls under the **low-volume** category in Rule 3. Thus, the **take profit range is +5% to +10%**.\n\n4. **Stop Loss:**  \n   The **medium volatility** (11.6% change) aligns with Rule 4\u2019s **-8% to -15%** stop-loss range.\n\n5. **Time Frame:**  \n   For **medium volatility**, Rule 5 suggests a **30-minute to 2-hour** time frame.\n\n---\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\n- **Action:** **BUY** (due to balanced buying pressure, recent positive momentum, and strong buying signals).  \n- **Limit Order:** **0%** (strong buying pressure).  \n- **Take Profit:** **+5% to +10%** (low volume).  \n- **Stop Loss:** **-8% to -15%** (medium volatility).  \n- **Time Frame:** **30 minutes to 2 hours** (medium volatility).  \n\n**Answer:**  \nBUY with a limit order at 0%, take profit between +5% and +10%, stop loss between -8% and -15%, and a time frame of 30 minutes to 2 hours.",
