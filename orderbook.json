      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the provided data, I will analyze and apply the dynamic trading parameters to determine a decision for the CLAWVAULT token.\n\n**Momentum Analysis:**\nThe flow momentum is STABLE. This suggests that there are no strong buying or selling pressures influencing the price movement. With 62 buys in each third of the trades (early, middle, recent), we see consistent buying activity. However, the buy/sell ratio (1.9) indicates a slight bias towards buying.\n\n**Trading Parameters:**\n\n1. **BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM:**\n   - Given the stable momentum and slightly biased buy/sell ratio, this scenario aligns with the \"STABLE momentum\" parameter.\n   \n2. **LIMIT ORDER (where to enter):**\n   - The token shows low volatility (< 10%) based on the price change (-9.8%). With no indication of strong buying pressure and stable trading activity, we lean towards a conservative entry.\n\n3. **TAKE PROFIT:**\n   - The volume is $9,219, which falls into the \"Medium volume ($3k-$10k)\" category. For medium volume tokens with stable momentum, take profits at +12% to +15%.\n\n4. **STOP LOSS:**\n   - Given low volatility and stable momentum, a tighter stop loss is reasonable but not overly aggressive.\n\n5. **TIME FRAME:**\n   - With stable momentum and no indication of strong trends or high volatility, a moderate time frame is suitable.\n\n**Decision Parameters Based on Analysis:**\n\n- **BUY:** The consistent buying activity and stable momentum suggest entering the market. However, considering the low volume, it might be prudent to enter with caution.\n  \n  BUY | Limit:-1% | TP:+12% | SL:-5% | Time:2h\n\nIf you prefer a more aggressive entry due to the slight bias towards buys:\n  \n  BUY | Limit:0% | TP:+15% | SL:-6% | Time:1.5h\n\n- **WATCH (or SKIP):** Given the stable momentum and consistent buying activity, while there's no immediate strong indication against buying, a cautious approach might be more prudent.\n\nThis analysis is based on the provided rules and parameters derived from the data given for the CLAWVAULT token. Adjustments can be made as new data becomes available, reflecting any changes in trading activity or price dynamics.",
