We'll exit in 2 hours to capture potential gains.\n\nIf you're cautious or want to monitor the market further, you could:\n\n**WATCH with brief reason: \"Stable momentum and moderate volume; consider waiting for stronger buying pressure.\"**\n\nPlease note that these parameters are generated based on the specific data provided.
