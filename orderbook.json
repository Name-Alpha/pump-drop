The limit order is set at -1%, which is near the current market price, given the low volatility. The take profit is set at +7%, considering the recent price increase and low volume. The stop loss is set at -6% to ensure some room to breathe in case of a potential dip. The time frame is 4h, allowing for some flexibility in case of a trend reversal.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on these dynamic trading parameters, the decision is:\n\nBUY | Limit:-1% | TP:+7% | SL:-6% | Time:4h",
