The aggressive entry (0% limit) is adjusted to -8% due to the high volatility. The take profit target is set at +7%, and the stop loss is set at -20%. The time frame is set to 3h.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe Ocean token has shown strong buying pressure with a buy/sell ratio of 1.5. The stable momentum indicates that the market is likely to continue trending upwards. However, the high volatility and low volume require caution. A bigger dip is needed before entering the market, which is reflected in the limit order at -8%. The take profit target is set early due to the low volume, while the stop loss provides room to breathe in case of a sharp decline.\n\n**Note:**\n\nThese parameters are dynamic and based on the specific data provided. They may change as new data becomes available.",
