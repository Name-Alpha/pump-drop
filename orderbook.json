The take profit is set at 15%, and the stop loss is -12% to limit potential losses.\n\nNote: As the buy/sell ratio is balanced, this trade carries moderate risk.",

The dynamic parameters will vary depending on the unique characteristics of each token.\n\n* If the buy/sell ratio were below 1.0, I would recommend WATCH (or SKIP) due to potential high risk.\n* If the momentum were ACCELERATING or DECELERATING, I would adjust the stop-loss and take-profit levels accordingly.\n* In case of high volatility, I would increase the time frame to capture more significant price movements.",
