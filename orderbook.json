      "ai_reasoning": "**Analysis and Decision:**\n\n1. **Buy/Sell Ratio Interpretation:**  \n   The given \"Buy/Sell Ratio: 0.7\" is ambiguous, but assuming it represents **sells/buys = 0.7**, this implies **more buys than sells** (strong buying pressure). This aligns with the rule for **strong buying (ratio > 1.5)** if the ratio is **buys/sells**, but the provided ratio (sells/buys = 0.7) suggests **buys > sells**, which is **strong buying** in the context of the rules.\n\n2. **Price Change and Volatility:**  \n   The price increased by **+14.2%**, which falls into **medium volatility** (10\u201350%). For medium volatility, the **limit order** is set at **-2% to -5%**, but **strong buying pressure** overrides this, leading to a **market order (0%)**.\n\n3. **Volume Consideration:**  \n   The volume is **$2,821** (low), so **take profit** is **+5% to +10%**, and **stop loss** is **-5% to -8%**.\n\n4. **Time Frame:**  \n   Low volume typically suggests a **shorter time frame** (2\u20136 hours) for execution.\n\n**Final Decision:**  \n**BUY** with **limit order at 0%** (market order), **take profit at +10%**, **stop loss at -8%**, and a **time frame of 2\u20136 hours**.  \n\n**Answer:**  \nBUY with limit order at 0%, take profit at +10%, stop loss at -8%, and time frame of 2\u20136 hours.",
