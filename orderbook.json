The limit order is set at -3%, taking into account the recent price drop. The take profit target is +12%, considering the medium volume. The stop loss is set at -10%, which is relatively conservative given the medium volatility.\n\n**Reasoning**\n\nThe strong buying pressure (Buy/Sell Ratio: 2.2) indicates a potential trend reversal or continuation, making it a good opportunity to enter long. The stable flow momentum suggests that traders are consistently buying, supporting the bullish sentiment. However, the recent price drop (-35.0%) may indicate some selling pressure, which is why we're setting a relatively conservative stop loss at -10%.",

The recent trade flow shows a stable momentum, and the early third and middle third of the trades also show a high percentage of buys (65% and 68%, respectively). This suggests that the buying pressure is not just a short-term phenomenon but has been building up over time.\n\n**Trading Parameters:**\n\nBUY | Limit:-0% | TP:+15% | SL:-10% | Time:4h\n\n* **Limit:** Since there's strong buying pressure, we'll enter at market price (no limit).\n* **Take Profit (TP):** +15% - This is a reasonable take profit target given the strong trend and liquidity.\n* **Stop Loss (SL):** -10% - With high buying pressure and stable momentum, we can afford to set a slightly tighter stop loss.\n* **Time Frame:** 4h - Given the strong trend and liquidity, we'll hold for at least 4 hours to allow the trade to develop.\n\nNote that these parameters are dynamic and based on specific data analysis.
