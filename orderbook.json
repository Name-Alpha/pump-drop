According to the rules:\n\t\t+ Balanced ratio (1.0-1.5) suggests WATCH or conservative BUY.\n\t\t+ However, considering the recent trades and flow momentum, we have a strong buying trend. Therefore, I will lean towards aggressive parameters for a BUY.\n2. **LIMIT ORDER (where to enter):**\n\t* High volatility (+23.5% price change), so we should wait for a bigger dip.\n\t* Considering the low volume ($4,528) and recent trades favoring buys, I'll adjust the limit order accordingly.\n3. **TAKE PROFIT:**\n\t* Low volume (< $3k). According to the rules, this suggests taking profit early:\n\t\t+ +5% to +10%\n4. **STOP LOSS:**\n\t* High volatility. Considering the price change and low volume, I'll set a more conservative stop loss:\n\t\t+ -15% to -25%\n5. **TIME FRAME:**\n\t* High volatility. According to the rules, this suggests a quick trade:\n\t\t+ 30min to 2h\n\n**Decision:**\n\nBUY | Limit:-8% | TP:+7% | SL:-20% | Time:1h\n\nThis decision is based on the strong buying pressure and stable momentum, with a limit order set at -8% below the current price to wait for a bigger dip. The take profit target is set at +7%, considering the low volume and high volatility. A stop loss of -20% will provide room to breathe in case of market fluctuations.\n\n**Note:** Please keep in mind that these parameters are specific to this Solana token \"awif\" and may not be applicable to other tokens or trading situations.
