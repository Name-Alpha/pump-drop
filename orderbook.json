      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the provided data, I will analyze the Lupe token and provide dynamic trading parameters.\n\n**Token Analysis**\n\nThe current price of Lupe is $0.00024543, with a volume of $8,934. The buy/sell ratio is 1.7 (213 buys vs 87 sells), indicating strong buying pressure. The recent trades show 4 consecutive buys in the last 5 trades and 75% buys in each third of the trade flow.\n\n**Dynamic Trading Parameters**\n\nBased on the critical rules:\n\n1. **BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM**: With a buy/sell ratio of 1.7, this is considered strong buying pressure.\n2. **LIMIT ORDER (where to enter)**: Given the low volatility (< 10%), we can enter near market with no waiting for a dip.\n3. **TAKE PROFIT**: With a medium volume ($8,934), we can aim for +15% to +20%.\n4. **STOP LOSS**: Considering the low volatility and strong buying pressure, we can set a stop loss at -5% to -8%.\n\n**Decision**\n\nBased on these parameters, I recommend:\n\nBUY | Limit:0% | TP:+17% | SL:-6% | Time:2h\n\nThis suggests entering the market with a market order (no waiting for a dip), aiming for a 17% profit, and setting a stop loss at -6%.\n\n**Reasoning**\n\nThe strong buying pressure, balanced momentum, and low volatility indicate that this token is in a good position to continue its upward trend. With a medium volume, we can aim for a moderate profit target while still allowing room for some price movement.\n\nNote: The \"Time\" parameter suggests a 2-hour time frame, which is suitable for this trade given the strong buying pressure and low volatility. This allows us to take advantage of any potential short-term momentum while minimizing our exposure to market fluctuations.",
