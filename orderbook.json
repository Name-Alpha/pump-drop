      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the provided data and dynamic trading parameters, here is the analysis for the HARAMBE / SOL token:\n\n**BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM:**\nThe buy/sell ratio is 0.9, indicating more sells than buys. This is a HIGH RISK situation.\n\n**LIMIT ORDER (where to enter):**\nConsidering the price change of +205.6%, which is HIGH VOLATILITY (> 50%), we should wait for a bigger dip. Let's set a limit order at -5% to -10%.\n\n**TAKE PROFIT:**\nThe volume is $6,473, which is considered LOW VOLUME (< $3k). To take profit early, let's set the target profit at +5% to +10%.\n\n**STOP LOSS:**\nGiven the HIGH VOLATILITY and low trading activity (131 buys out of 300 trades), we should have some room to breathe. Let's set the stop loss at -15% to -25%.\n\n**TIME FRAME:**\nWith HIGH VOLATILITY, let's consider a shorter time frame. Given the recent price action, it's best to trade within a short window. However, with the low trading activity, we may want to extend the time frame slightly. Let's set the time frame at 1h.\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\nGiven the HIGH RISK situation and the need for caution, I recommend **WATCH** (or possibly **SKIP**) due to the more sells than buys ratio and the high volatility.\n\nHowever, if you still want to enter the market with caution, here is a possible trade setup:\n\nBUY | Limit:-8% | TP:+5% | SL:-20% | Time:1h\n\nThis setup takes into account the high risk situation, low trading activity, and high volatility. The limit order is set at -8%, which is more conservative than the initial -5% to -10%. The target profit is set at +5%, which is slightly lower due to the high risk. The stop loss is set at -20%, giving some room for price movement.\n\nPlease note that this setup is cautious and not an aggressive entry. It's essential to continuously monitor the market and adjust your strategy accordingly.",
