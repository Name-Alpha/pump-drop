      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the provided data, I will analyze the token and provide dynamic trading parameters.\n\n**Momentum Analysis**\n\nThe Buy/Sell Ratio is 0.8, indicating a slight bias towards selling. However, the recent trades show a strong buying trend, with 4 buys in the last 5 trades. The Flow Momentum is STABLE.\n\n**Trading Parameters**\n\n1. **BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM**\n\t* Since there are more sells than buys (ratio < 1.0), we will consider this a high-risk situation.\n2. **LIMIT ORDER (where to enter)**\n\t* Price Change: +6.0% (medium volatility)\n\t* Strong buying pressure is evident, but the price change is not extremely high (>50%). We'll use a -2% limit order.\n3. **TAKE PROFIT**\n\t* Volume: $1,659 (low volume)\n\t* We will take profit early to avoid holding positions for too long in low-volume markets.\n4. **STOP LOSS**\n\t* Volatility is moderate, and we want some room to breathe. A -12% stop loss seems reasonable.\n\n**Trading Decision**\n\nBased on these parameters, I recommend:\n\nBUY | Limit:-2% | TP:+7% | SL:-12% | Time:1h\n\nReasoning:\nWe're taking a conservative approach due to the high-risk situation (more sells than buys). The limit order is set at -2%, which allows us to enter near market price. We'll aim for a 7% take profit, considering the low volume and moderate volatility. A stop loss of -12% will provide some room to breathe.\n\nPlease note that this analysis is based on specific data points and may not reflect the token's future performance.
