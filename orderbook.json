The market order entry will allow us to capitalize on potential buying pressure, while taking profit early at +7% will help lock in gains. The stop loss of -6.5% will provide a reasonable safety net.\n\nNote: As always, this is not investment advice, and you should do your own research before making any trading decisions.",
