      "ai_reasoning": "**Analysis and Decision:**\n\n1. **Ratio Interpretation:**\n   - The provided ratio is **0.9**. Assuming this is **buys/sells**, it implies **sells are more than buys**, indicating **high risk** (ratio < 1.0). However, recent trades (174 buys, 126 sells) suggest **buys are higher**, which contradicts the ratio. This discrepancy likely stems from a miscalculation or misinterpretation of the ratio. For consistency, we'll **assume the ratio is buys/sells = 1.38** (174/126), placing it in the **balanced** category (1.0\u20131.5).\n\n2. **Flow Momentum:**\n   - **Stable** momentum suggests standard parameters.\n\n3. **Limit Order:**\n   - **Price change = +0.5%** (low volatility). Rule 2: **0% to -2%** (enter near market).\n\n4. **Take Profit:**\n   - **Volume = $5,629** (low volume). Rule 3: **+5% to +10%**.\n\n5. **Stop Loss:**\n   - **Low volatility** \u2192 **-5% to -8%**.\n\n6. **Time Frame:**\n   - **Low volume** \u2192 **2h to 6h**.\n\n**Final Decision:**  \n**Watch** (balanced buying pressure, stable momentum, and low volatility).  \n\n**Recommendation:**  \nMonitor the market closely with conservative entry and tight stop-loss. Adjust based on real-time data if the ratio discrepancy is resolved.",
