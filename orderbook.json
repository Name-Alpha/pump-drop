Combined with the recent 4 buys in last 5 trades, this suggests a **conservative BUY** with aggressive parameters.  \n- **LIMIT ORDER:** Strong buying pressure (recent trades) overrides low volatility (3.8% price change), so **0% limit** (market order).  \n- **TAKE PROFIT:** Low volume ($7,190) dictates a **+10% TP** to lock in gains early.  \n- **STOP LOSS:** Low volatility (-5% to -8%) with a **-8% SL** to protect against sudden dips.  \n- **TIME FRAME:** Short-term (2h) to capitalize on stable momentum and low volume.  \n\n**Key Signal:** Strong buying pressure in recent trades and flow, despite a balanced ratio, warrants a **BUY** with tight risk/reward.",
