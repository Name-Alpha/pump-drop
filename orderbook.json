      "ai_reasoning": "**Analysis and Decision:**\n\n1. **Buy/Sell Ratio:**  \n   The user provided a **Buy/Sell Ratio of 1.5**, which falls into the **\"balanced\"** category (1.0\u20131.5). However, this contradicts the **recent trades** (30 buys, 270 sells) which imply a ratio of **0.111** (i.e., **more sells than buys**). This inconsistency suggests a possible data error. Assuming the ratio is **1.5** (strong buying pressure), the decision leans toward **BUY**. If the ratio is **0.111**, the decision would be **SKIP or WATCH** due to **more sells than buys**.\n\n2. **Price Change (Volatility):**  \n   A **+7.9%** price change is **low volatility** (high >50%, medium 10\u201350%, low <10%). For low volatility, **limit orders** are set at **0% to -2%** (market entry). However, if the ratio is **1.5** (strong buying), **limit order** is **0%** (market order).\n\n3. **Take Profit (Volume):**  \n   Volume of **$49,510** is **medium**. For medium volume, **take profit** is **+10% to +20%**.\n\n4. **Stop Loss (Volatility):**  \n   Low volatility implies **stop loss** of **-5% to -8%**.\n\n5. **Time Frame:**  \n   Medium volume suggests a **2-hour to 6-hour** time frame for trading.\n\n6. **Flow Momentum:**  \n   The **stable** flow momentum indicates **standard parameters** should be used.\n\n---\n\n**Final Decision:**  \nAssuming the **Buy/Sell Ratio of 1.5** is accurate (strong buying), the decision is to **BUY** with the following parameters:\n\n- **Limit Order:** 0% (market entry)  \n- **Take Profit:** +10% to +20%  \n- **Stop Loss:** -5% to -8%  \n- **Time Frame:** 2 hours to 6 hours  \n\n**Answer:**  \n**BUY** | Limit: 0% | Take Profit: +10% to +20% | Stop Loss: -5% to -8% | Time Frame: 2h to 6h  \n\n**Note:** If the actual ratio (0.111) is correct, the decision would be **SKIP or WATCH** due to **more sells than buys**.

      "ai_reasoning": "**Analysis and Decision:**\n\nGiven the data provided, we must evaluate the scenario using the rules outlined, even with potential ambiguity in the buy/sell ratio. Here's the breakdown:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Buy/Sell Ratio (Rule 1):**\n- **Overall ratio:** 0.9 (buys/sells) \u2192 **Less than 1.0**  \n- **Interpretation:** This indicates **more sells than buys** on aggregate, which is a **high-risk** signal.  \n- **Rule 1 Guidance:**  \n  - If the ratio is **less than 1.0**, the recommendation is **to skip or watch** (i.e., avoid active buying and monitor for potential reversal).  \n\n**Conclusion:** Despite recent trades showing a higher ratio (1.22), the **overall ratio of 0.9** dominates the decision-making process. Thus, the **initial recommendation is to \"watch\"** for potential shifts in sentiment.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Price Change and Volatility (Rule 2):**\n- **Price change:** +7.3% (recent upward movement)  \n- **Volatility classification:** **Low** (since 7.3% < 10%)  \n- **Rule 2 Guidance:**  \n  - **Low volatility:** Use **limit order at 0% to -2%** (enter near market)  \n  - **Strong buying pressure:** If confirmed, use **0%** as the entry point.  \n\n**Conclusion:** Since the overall ratio is still less than 1.0, **limit orders should be placed at 0% to -2%** to avoid over-leveraging in a potentially weak market.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Take Profit (Rule 3):**\n- **Volume:** $1,723 (low volume)  \n- **Rule 3 Guidance:**  \n  - **Low volume:** Target **+5% to +10%** for take profit.  \n\n**Conclusion:** Given the low volume, **take profit at +5% to +10%** is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Stop Loss (Rule 4):**\n- **Volume:** $1,723 (low volume)  \n- **Rule 4 Guidance:**  \n  - **Low volume:** Set **stop loss at -5% to -8%**.  \n\n**Conclusion:** **Stop loss at -5% to -8%** to protect against sudden downturns.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Time Frame (Rule 5):**\n- **Volume:** Low  \n- **Rule 5 Guidance:**  \n  - **Low volume:** Use **2-hour to 6-hour time frame** for monitoring.  \n\n**Conclusion:** **Monitor the trade over 2\u20136 hours** to assess short-term trends.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n**Watch** the market for any signs of reversal or increased buying pressure. While recent trades suggest a **positive trend**, the **overall ratio of 0.9** indicates **higher sell pressure**, which warrants caution.  \n\n- **Entry:** Place limit orders at **0% to -2%**.  \n- **Take Profit:** Target **+5% to +10%**.  \n- **Stop Loss:** Set at **-5% to -8%**.  \n- **Time Frame:** Monitor over **2\u20136 hours**.  \n\n**Decision:** \u26a0\ufe0f **Watch** the market for potential shifts in sentiment. Avoid active buying unless the ratio improves.",
