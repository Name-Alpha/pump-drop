However, **recent trades** and **trade flow momentum** (stable) suggest some buying pressure.  \n- **Price change (+8.8%)** falls under **low volatility**, and **volume ($2,160)** is low, aligning with rules for conservative parameters.  \n- Despite the ratio, **stable momentum** and **buying pressure** justify a **WATCH** decision rather than an immediate skip, allowing for further observation.  \n\n**Note:** The ratio and recent trades create conflicting signals, but the rules prioritize the ratio as the primary factor. The WATCH decision balances caution with the observed buying pressure.",

      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the provided data and the rules outlined, here's a structured analysis and recommendation:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Inputs and Analysis:**\n\n1. **Buy/Sell Ratio:**  \n   - The user states the ratio is **1.3**, which falls within the **balanced range (1.0\u20131.5)**.  \n   - However, the **recent trades** (300 total) show **147 buys** and **153 sells**, which would imply a **ratio of ~0.96**, suggesting more sells. This discrepancy may indicate an error or misinterpretation in the ratio. For the sake of this analysis, we will **assume the user's stated ratio of 1.3 is correct**, as it aligns with the rules.\n\n2. **Price Change:**  \n   - The price increased by **+11.0%**, which is **medium volatility** (10\u201350% range).  \n\n3. **Volume:**  \n   - The volume is **$9,491**, which is **medium** (between $3k and $10k).  \n\n4. **Flow Momentum:**  \n   - The trade flow is **stable**, indicating consistent buying pressure across timeframes.  \n\n---\n\n### **Rule-Based Recommendations:**\n\n#### **1. Buy/Sell Ratio (Rule 1):**  \n- **Ratio = 1.3** (balanced range).  \n- **Decision:** **Watch** (or conservative buy) due to balanced buying/selling pressure.  \n\n#### **2. Limit Order (Rule 2):**  \n- **Volatility:** Medium (10\u201350%).  \n- **Limit Order Range:** **-2% to -5%** (to account for potential pullbacks).  \n\n#### **3. Take Profit (Rule 3):**  \n- **Volume:** Medium ($3k\u2013$10k).  \n- **Take Profit Range:** **+10% to +20%** (to capture medium-term gains).  \n\n#### **4. Stop Loss (Rule 4):**  \n- **Volatility:** Medium.  \n- **Stop Loss Range:** **-8% to -15%** (to protect against adverse price movements).  \n\n#### **5. Time Frame (Rule 5):**  \n- **Volatility:** Medium.  \n- **Time Frame:** **4\u201312 hours** (to align with medium-term trends).  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendation:**\n\n- **Action:** **Watch** the market closely due to the balanced ratio and stable flow.  \n- **Strategy:**  \n  - Place a **limit order at -2% to -5%** to enter a potential pullback.  \n  - Set a **take profit target at +10% to +20%**.  \n  - Use a **stop loss at -8% to -15%** to manage risk.  \n  - Monitor the time frame of **4\u201312 hours** for short-term trends.  \n\nThis approach balances risk and reward while respecting the market conditions and the user's stated inputs. If the ratio discrepancy persists, further clarification on the data source would improve accuracy.",
