However, recent trades have shown a slight increase in buys (3 out of last 5 trades). The momentum is STABLE, but leaning towards ACCELERATING due to the recent buying pressure.\n\n* **Aggressive entry:** Yes\n* **Target Price (TP):** +10% (a moderate target, considering the stable momentum and balanced market)\n* **Stop Loss (SL):** -8% (a relatively tight SL, given the low volatility and stable momentum)\n\n**Limit Order:**\nThe token has a price change of -55.4%, which is considered high volatility. However, recent trades have shown a slight increase in buying pressure, indicating some strength.\n\n* **Limit:** -2% to -5% (a moderate limit, considering the high volatility and recent buying pressure)\n\n**Time Frame:**\nThe token has a low volume of $24,775, which is relatively stable. The time frame should be set to accommodate this low volume.\n\n* **Time:** 4h\n\nConsidering these parameters:\n\n* **Trade Parameters:** BUY | Limit:-3% | TP:+10% | SL:-8% | Time:4h\n\nThis trade plan suggests buying AURA/SOL at -3% of the current price, targeting a 10% profit, and setting a stop loss at -8%. The time frame is set to 4 hours, allowing for some market fluctuation.\n\n**Final Decision:** BUY",
