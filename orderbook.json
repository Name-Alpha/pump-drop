BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM:\n\t* Ratio: 1.1 (more buys than sells)\n\t* Momentum: STABLE\n\t* Rule application: Since the ratio is above 1.0 but not strongly above 1.5, we consider it balanced buying pressure. With stable momentum, standard parameters apply.\n2. LIMIT ORDER:\n\t* Price change: -36.2% (high volatility)\n\t* Volume: $8,445 (low volume, considering high price change)\n\t* Rule application: Due to the high volatility and low volume, we'll enter with a smaller limit order to wait for a bigger dip.\n3. TAKE PROFIT:\n\t* Volume: $8,445 (low volume)\n\t* Rule application: With low volume, it's best to take profit early.\n4. STOP LOSS:\n\t* Price change: -36.2% (high volatility)\n\t* Rule application: Due to the high price change and volatility, we'll set a wider stop loss for some room to breathe.\n\nConsidering these factors, here are the dynamic trading parameters:\n\n**BUY**\nBUY | Limit:-5% | TP:+10% | SL:-12% | Time:2h\n\nThe limit order is at -5% because of the high volatility and low volume. The take profit target is set at +10%, considering the low volume. The stop loss is at -12%, giving some room to breathe due to the high price change.\n\nNote: Since the token has a low volume, it's essential to monitor the market closely and adjust the parameters if necessary.",

      "ai_reasoning": "After analyzing the data, I'll provide dynamic trading parameters for the AlienCat/SOL token.\n\n**Momentum and Buy/Sell Pressure:**\nThe buy/sell ratio is 1.2, which indicates balanced pressure. However, considering the recent trades have a majority of buys (4 out of last 5), we can consider this as strong buying pressure.\n\n* Momentum: STABLE\n* Buy/Sell Ratio: 1.2\n\nBased on the rules:\n\n* Since the buy/sell ratio is above 1.0, it's not high-risk to enter.\n* With strong buying pressure, we should be aggressive but not overly so since momentum is stable.\n\n**Limit Order (Where to Enter):**\nConsidering the price change is -29.2%, which is below our threshold for high volatility (> 50%), and with a relatively low volume ($15,224), we can consider entering near market prices.\n\n* Limit: 0% to -1% (enter near market)\n\n**Take Profit:**\nWith a medium volume of $15,224, we should aim for moderate take profit targets.\n\n* Take Profit: +10% to +20%\n\n**Stop Loss:**\nGiven the low volatility and stable momentum, our stop loss can be relatively tight.\n\n* Stop Loss: -5% to -8%\n\n**Time Frame:**\nConsidering the balanced buy/sell ratio and stable momentum, we don't need an extremely short time frame. A moderate 2h to 4h timeframe should suffice.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nBUY | Limit:0% | TP:+15% | SL:-7% | Time:3h\n\nThis entry is aggressive due to the strong buying pressure but enters near market prices, which reduces risk. The take profit target of +15% and stop loss of -7% are moderate based on the volume and momentum analysis.\n\nPlease note that this analysis is for educational purposes only, and it's essential to adjust parameters according to your personal trading strategy and preferences.
