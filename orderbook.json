      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the provided data, I will calculate dynamic trading parameters for the FREEBIRD token.\n\n**Current Data:**\n\n* Current Price: $0.00007166\n* Volume: $3,023\n* Buy/Sell Ratio: 0.6 (more sells than buys)\n* Price Change: -3.6%\n* Recent trades: 4 buys in the last 5 trades\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM:**\n\t* Buy/Sell Ratio: 0.6, which indicates more sells than buys (high risk). Therefore, we will consider a \"SKIP\" strategy.\n2. **LIMIT ORDER:**\n\t* Price Change: -3.6%, which is a low volatility condition (< 10%). We will enter near the market with a small discount.\n\t* Strong buying pressure: 4 buys in the last 5 trades, but it's not enough to change our initial assessment of \"SKIP\".\n3. **TAKE PROFIT:**\n\t* Volume: $3,023 (low volume), so we'll aim for a smaller take profit to avoid liquidation risks.\n4. **STOP LOSS:**\n\t* Low volatility condition, so we'll set a tighter stop loss to minimize losses.\n5. **TIME FRAME:**\n\t* Since the token has low trading activity and price fluctuations, we'll consider a longer time frame to capture potential movements.\n\n**Trading Parameters:**\n\nGiven these conditions, I recommend:\n\nWATCH | Limit:-0.2% | TP:+8% | SL:-4% | Time: 6h\n\nReasoning:\nWe're WATCHING the token due to high risk (more sells than buys). We'll enter near the market with a small discount (-0.2%). The take profit is set at +8% to capture potential gains, and the stop loss is -4% to minimize losses. With low trading activity, we'll consider a 6h time frame to allow for some price movement.\n\nNote: If you prefer a more aggressive approach, you can adjust the parameters accordingly, but keep in mind that this will increase your risk exposure.",

      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the given data, I will provide dynamic trading parameters for Ragebait/SOL.\n\n**Buy/Sell Pressure & Momentum:**\nThe buy/sell ratio is 1.4, indicating a slight imbalance towards buying. The recent trades show 4 buys in the last 5 trades, and the flow momentum is STABLE. This suggests a stable market with moderate buying pressure.\n\n**Limit Order (where to enter):**\nConsidering the price change of +17.4%, which falls into the medium volatility category (10-50%), I will set the limit order entry as -2% to -5%.\n\n**Take Profit:**\nGiven the low volume of $1,852, which is less than $3k, I will set the take profit at +5% to +10%. This allows for an early exit with a moderate profit.\n\n**Stop Loss:**\nWith medium volatility and stable momentum, I will set the stop loss at -8% to -15%.\n\n**Time Frame:**\nConsidering the low volume and medium volatility, I will set the time frame at 2h to 6h. This allows for some room to breathe while still being agile in case of a market shift.\n\n**Decision:**\nBUY | Limit:-3% | TP:+7% | SL:-10% | Time:4h\n\nThis decision is based on moderate buying pressure, stable momentum, and low volume, which indicates a potentially profitable trade with a relatively safe entry point.",
