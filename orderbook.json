It's essential to wait for a clearer trend or stronger buying pressure before entering a trade.\n\nIf you still want to enter, consider setting a limit order at -5% and adjusting the stop loss to -10%. However, be cautious of the high risk involved.\n\nRemember that these parameters are dynamic and based on specific data. Always monitor the token's behavior and adjust your strategy accordingly.",

      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the provided data, I will analyze the Lilypad token and provide dynamic trading parameters.\n\n**1. BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM:**\nThe buy/sell ratio is 1.8, indicating strong buying pressure. The flow momentum is STABLE, which means there's no significant acceleration or deceleration in trading activity.\n\nBased on these factors, I recommend:\n\n* **BUY with aggressive parameters**: since the buying pressure is strong and there's a stable momentum\n\n**2. LIMIT ORDER (where to enter):**\nThe volume is $4,095, which is considered low. The price change is +8.6%, indicating moderate volatility.\n\nConsidering these factors, I recommend entering at:\n\n* **-1%**: to wait for a slightly larger dip, given the low volume and moderate volatility\n\n**3. TAKE PROFIT:**\nThe volume is $4,095, which is below the medium volume threshold ($3k-$10k). Therefore, I recommend:\n\n* **+5% to +10%**: taking profit early, as there's less liquidity to exit with\n\n**4. STOP LOSS:**\nThe volatility is moderate (price change +8.6%), so I recommend a stop loss of:\n\n* **-8% to -15%**: providing some room for the price to move without significant risk\n\n**5. TIME FRAME:**\nGiven the low volume, I recommend a shorter time frame to react quickly to any changes in trading activity.\n\nBased on these parameters, here's the decision:\n\n**BUY | Limit:-1% | TP:+7% | SL:-10% | Time:2h**\n\nReasoning:\nThe Lilypad token has strong buying pressure and stable momentum, indicating a potential uptrend. Entering at -1% gives us some room to breathe while taking profit early at +5% to +10%. The stop loss is set at -8% to -15%, considering the moderate volatility. With a time frame of 2 hours, we can react quickly to any changes in trading activity.\n\nNote that this analysis is based on a single snapshot of data and may not be representative of future market conditions.",

BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM**\n\nBuy/Sell Ratio: 1.3 (slightly above 1.0)\nRecent trades: 2 buys in last 5 trades\nPrevious 5 trades: 5 buys\n\nGiven the balanced buy/sell ratio and recent strong buying pressure, I would consider this a \"strong buying\" scenario.\n\n**Accelerating momentum**: Given the STABLE flow momentum and slight increase in buying activity over time, we can assume accelerating momentum.\n\nThus, for a BUY order:\n\n* **Aggressive BUY**: due to strong buying pressure and accelerating momentum\n\n**2. LIMIT ORDER (where to enter)**\n\nPrice Change: -11.5% (moderate volatility)\nVolume: $6,599 (medium volume)\n\nGiven the moderate volatility and medium volume, I would aim for a limit order slightly below market price.\n\n* **Limit:** -2%\n\n**3. TAKE PROFIT**\n\nHigh volume (> $10k) is not met ($6,599), so we will use medium volume parameters.\n* **Take Profit (TP): +10% to +20%**, aiming for the higher end given strong buying pressure and accelerating momentum.\n\n**4. STOP LOSS**\n\nModerate volatility (-11.5%) suggests a relatively tight stop loss.\n* **Stop Loss (SL): -8% to -12%**, aiming for the tighter end given stable flow momentum.\n\n**5. TIME FRAME**\n\nGiven medium volume, I would suggest a moderate time frame.\n* **Time Frame:** 2h\n\nConsidering these parameters:\n\n**BUY**\nBUY | Limit:-2% | TP:+18% | SL:-9% | Time:2h\n\nThis BUY order is based on strong buying pressure and accelerating momentum. The limit order is set at -2%, aiming for a slightly below-market entry, while the take profit target is +18%, allowing for some appreciation in price.
