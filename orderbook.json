The low volume suggests caution is necessary but doesn't justify skipping entirely.\n\nThe decision does not include aggressive parameters due to the stable nature of recent trades and the low volatility indicated by the +5.4% price change, which doesn\u2019t suggest a high-risk environment for entry or exit.",
