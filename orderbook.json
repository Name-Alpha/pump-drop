BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM:**\n\nThe buy/sell ratio is 1.5, indicating strong buying pressure. However, considering the recent trades (4 buys in the last 5 trades), momentum seems to be slightly accelerating. Therefore:\n\n* Accelerating momentum indicates a more aggressive entry.\n* Strong buying pressure justifies entering with market orders.\n\n**2. LIMIT ORDER:**\n\nThe price change is -20.2%, indicating low volatility (< 10%). The token also has strong buying pressure, which suggests entering near the market.\n\nLimit: 0% (market order)\n\n**3. TAKE PROFIT:**\n\nThe volume is $1,511, which falls under low volume (< $3k). To take profit early:\n\n* Take Profit: +5% to +10%\n\n**4. STOP LOSS:**\n\nConsidering the low volatility and strong buying pressure, a tighter stop loss seems appropriate.\n\nStop Loss: -5% to -8%\n\n**5. TIME FRAME:**\n\nWith accelerating momentum and strong buying pressure, a shorter time frame is suitable for this trade:\n\nTime Frame: 30min\n\nGiven these parameters, I will output the decision in the required format:\n\nBUY | Limit:0% | TP:+7% | SL:-6% | Time:30m",
