Aggressive buying in the recent third (51% buys) offsets the slight sell bias.  \n- **Volatility:** +32.9% price change falls into **medium volatility**, so limit order is set at **-2%**.  \n- **Volume:** $1,130 is **low volume**, so take profit is **+5%** (early exit) and stop loss is **-5%** (tighter for low liquidity).  \n- **Time Frame:** Low volume and stable momentum suggest **2h** for quick entry/exit.  \n- **Momentum:** Stable flow implies no acceleration, so standard parameters apply.  \n\n**Decision:** BUY with conservative parameters to capitalize on balanced pressure and medium volatility.",
