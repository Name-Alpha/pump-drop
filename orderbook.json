ACCELERATING momentum is not evident.\n2. **LIMIT ORDER**: Since the price change is moderate and volume is low, we'll use a limit order near the market: **0%** (enter at current market price).\n3. **TAKE PROFIT**: Considering the low volume, it's essential to take profit early: **+5%**.\n4. **STOP LOSS**: Given the moderate volatility and low volume, set a relatively tight stop loss: **-8%**.\n5. **TIME FRAME**: For low-volume tokens with stable momentum, we'll use a standard time frame: **2h**.\n\nBased on these dynamic parameters:\n\n**BUY | Limit:0% | TP:+5% | SL:-8% | Time:2h**\n\nNote that if the situation changes (e.g., volume increases or price fluctuates significantly), these parameters might need to be adjusted.",
