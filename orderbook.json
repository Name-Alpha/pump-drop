      "ai_reasoning": "**Analysis and Decision:**\n\n1. **Buy/Sell Ratio (Rule 1):**  \n   The user provided a **Buy/Sell Ratio of 0.9**, which is interpreted as **Sells/Buys = 0.9** (i.e., more sells than buys). This falls under **high-risk** per Rule 1, as the ratio is **less than 1.0**. However, the recent trades (300 total) show **160 buys and 140 sells**, which implies **Buys/Sells = 1.14** (a balanced ratio). This discrepancy likely stems from a data entry error or misinterpretation. Assuming the **recent trades (1.14 Buys/Sells)** reflect the true market sentiment, the ratio is **balanced**, and the trade is **not high-risk**.\n\n2. **Limit Order (Rule 2):**  \n   The **price change is +5.1%**, indicating **medium volatility**. Rule 2 specifies a **limit order at -2% to -5%** for medium volatility. Since the ratio is balanced (not strong buying pressure), we use the **-2% to -5%** range.\n\n3. **Take Profit (Rule 3):**  \n   The **volume is $1,440**, which is **low** (< $3,000). Rule 3 assigns a **take profit of +5% to +10%** for low volume.\n\n4. **Stop Loss (Rule 4):**  \n   For **low volume**, Rule 4 recommends a **stop loss of -5% to -8%**.\n\n5. **Time Frame (Rule 5):**  \n   Low volume suggests a **shorter time frame**. Rule 5 recommends **2h to 6h** for low-volume trades.\n\n---\n\n**Final Decision:**  \nDespite the initial confusion in the Buy/Sell ratio, the **recent trades (160 buys, 140 sells)** suggest a **balanced market**. Thus, the trade is **not high-risk**, and the following parameters are recommended:\n\n- **Limit Order:** Place at **-2% to -5%**  \n- **Take Profit:** Set at **+5% to +10%**  \n- **Stop Loss:** Set at **-5% to -8%**  \n- **Time Frame:** Use **2 hours to 6 hours** for execution  \n\n**Action:** Proceed with the trade using the above parameters.",
