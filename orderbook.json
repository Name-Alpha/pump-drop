      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the provided data, I'll analyze the token APEX/SOL and provide dynamic trading parameters.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n\n* Current Price: $0.00001453\n* Volume: $1,138\n* Buy/Sell Ratio: 0.9 (more sells than buys)\n* Recent trades (300 total): 154 buys, 146 sells\n* Last 5 trades: 3 buys\n* Trade Flow: STABLE momentum\n\n**DYNAMIC TRADING PARAMETERS**\n\nBased on the rules provided:\n\n1. **BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM**\n\t* Since there are more sells than buys (ratio < 1.0), I'll evaluate this as **HIGH RISK**.\n2. **LIMIT ORDER**\n\t* Given the **STABLE momentum**, the volume is low ($1,138), and price change is relatively stable (+5.6%), I recommend a **-1% to -2%** entry point (enter near market).\n3. **TAKE PROFIT**\n\t* With low volume, I'll opt for a more conservative TP: +5% to +7%.\n4. **STOP LOSS**\n\t* Considering the stable momentum and relatively low price change, I recommend a moderate SL: -8% to -10%.\n5. **TIME FRAME**\n\t* Given the low volatility, I suggest a 2h to 6h time frame.\n\n**FINAL DECISION**\n\nBased on these parameters, I recommend:\n\nBUY | Limit:-1.5% | TP:+6% | SL:-9% | Time:4h\n\nReasoning: Although there's more selling pressure than buying, the momentum is stable, and the price change is relatively stable. With a conservative entry point and moderate take profit and stop loss levels, this trade aims to capitalize on potential upward movement.\n\nPlease note that these parameters are based on dynamic analysis and might need adjustments as new data becomes available. It's essential to continuously monitor market conditions and adjust your strategy accordingly.",

The token may be experiencing a natural correction or consolidation phase, making it essential to wait for a clearer signal before entering.\n\nIf you still want to trade, consider setting up a LIMIT ORDER at market price with the following parameters:\n\nBUY | Limit:0% | TP:+5% | SL:-5% | Time:2h",
