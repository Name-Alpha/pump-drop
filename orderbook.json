The flow momentum is STABLE, which means we can apply standard parameters.\n\n**Limit Order (Entry)**\nGiven the low volatility (<10%) and strong buying pressure, we'll enter near market. Since there's no high volume (> $10k), we won't consider a bigger dip. **LIMIT:-0%**\n\n**Take Profit**\nThe volume is $15,350, which falls within the medium volume category ($3k-$10k). We'll aim for a 15-20% profit to balance between liquidity and risk. **TP:+17.5%**\n\n**Stop Loss**\nConsidering the low volatility (<10%), we'll set a relatively tight stop loss of -5% to -8%. Given the recent price change (-15.4%) is within this range, we won't make it too aggressive. **SL:-6.5%**\n\n**Time Frame**\nGiven the stable momentum and medium volume, we'll aim for a 2h time frame to balance between quick profit and liquidity.\n\nDecision: BUY\n\nFormat:\nBUY | Limit:-0% | TP:+17.5% | SL:-6.5% | Time:2h",

It's better to wait for more bullish signals before entering the trade.\n\nNote that the current price is already relatively low (-4.2% change), which might suggest a potential rebound or correction. However, without more decisive indicators, it's safer to WAIT rather than risking a loss with an aggressive entry.",
