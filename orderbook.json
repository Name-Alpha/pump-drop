Despite recent trades showing a **balanced ratio (1.22)** and **stable momentum**, the overall ratio remains the primary determinant under the given data. The **positive price change (+8.8%)** and **low volume ($21,986)** further suggest caution, aligning with the WATCH decision.\n\n**Parameter Adjustments:**  \n- **LIMIT ORDER:** Medium volatility (8.8% price change) \u2192 **-2% to -5%**.  \n- **TAKE PROFIT:** Medium volatility \u2192 **-5% to -8%** (adjusting for potential consolidation).  \n- **STOP LOSS:** Conservative approach \u2192 **-3% to -6%** to mitigate downside risk.  \n- **TIME FRAME:** Short to medium-term (e.g., 3\u20137 days) to monitor trend confirmation or reversal.  \n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile recent activity hints at buying pressure, the **overall risk profile** warrants a **WATCH** strategy to avoid overexposure. Adjustments are made to balance potential upside with risk management.",

      "ai_reasoning": "**Analysis and Decision:**\n\n1. **Buy/Sell Ratio:**  \n   The provided ratio is **0.9** (sells/buys), which is less than 1.0. According to the rules, this indicates **more sells** (high risk), falling into the **high-risk** category. However, the recent trades (174 buys, 126 sells) suggest a **buys/sells ratio of ~1.38**, which is **balanced** (1.0\u20131.5). This discrepancy may stem from a misinterpretation or error in the ratio's calculation. Assuming the **correct ratio is 1.38** (buys/sells), it falls within the **balanced** range, suggesting **conservative buying** or **watching**.\n\n2. **Price Change:**  \n   The price increased by **+8.3%**, which is **low volatility** (<10%). Rule 2 specifies a **limit order range of 0% to -2%** for low volatility.\n\n3. **Volume:**  \n   The volume is **$952**, which is **low** (<$3k). Rule 3 assigns a **take profit (TP) range of +5% to +10%** and a **stop loss (SL) range of -5% to -8%** for low volume.\n\n4. **Flow Momentum:**  \n   The momentum is **stable**, so Rule 1 recommends **standard parameters** for balanced conditions.\n\n5. **Final Decision:**  \n   Despite the conflicting ratio data, the **recent trades and flow momentum** suggest **bullish sentiment**. However, the **buy/sell ratio of 1.38** (balanced) aligns with **conservative buying**. Thus, the decision is **conservative buying** with **standard parameters**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n**BUY** with the following parameters:  \n- **Limit Order:** 0% to -2%  \n- **Take Profit (TP):** +5% to +10%  \n- **Stop Loss (SL):** -5% to -8%  \n- **Time Frame:** 2h to 6h  \n\n**Reasoning:** The recent trades and stable momentum indicate bullish potential, and the balanced buy/sell ratio justifies a conservative approach.",
