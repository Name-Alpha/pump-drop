      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the provided data, I'll calculate dynamic trading parameters for JOOBI/SOL.\n\n**Volatility & Price Change:** High volatility is not indicated by a price change of only +4.0%. However, considering the recent trades and the fact that 178 buys out of 300 total trades are in favor of buying, we can infer strong buying pressure. We'll use this to adjust our parameters accordingly.\n\n**Buy/Sell Ratio & Momentum:** The buy/sell ratio is 1.3 (favors buying), indicating a balance between buying and selling pressures with an inclination towards buying. This is not a strong signal for aggressive buying but rather a standard buying environment.\n\n**Trade Flow Analysis:**\n\n* Early third (100 trades): 62 buys (62.0%) - Balanced, leaning slightly towards buying.\n* Middle third (100 trades): 62 buys (62.0%) - Same as above.\n* Recent third (100 trades): 62 buys (62.0%) - Indicates a sustained level of buying interest.\n\n**Flow Momentum:** Stable momentum is observed across all thirds of the trade flow, indicating steady buying without significant acceleration or deceleration.\n\nConsidering these points:\n\n1. **BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM:**\n   - Balanced environment leaning slightly towards buying but not strong enough to warrant aggressive entry.\n   \n2. **LIMIT ORDER (where to enter):** Given the stable momentum and slight favor towards buying, it's reasonable to enter near the market.\n\n3. **TAKE PROFIT:** Since volume is $3,820, which falls in the medium volume category, we'll adjust our take profit parameters accordingly.\n\n4. **STOP LOSS:** The low volatility environment (considering price change) suggests using tighter stop loss values compared to high volatility scenarios.\n\n5. **TIME FRAME:** Given the stable momentum and lack of a strong trend indicated by recent trades, a time frame that balances quick action with some patience might be appropriate.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- **BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM:** WATCH - Balanced environment leaning slightly towards buying.\n- **LIMIT ORDER (where to enter):** 0% (Market order, as the stable momentum and slight favor towards buying indicate entering near market conditions without waiting for a bigger dip.)\n- **TAKE PROFIT:** +10% to +20%\n- **STOP LOSS:** -5% to -8%\n- **TIME FRAME:** 2h\n\nGiven these parameters:\n\n**Decision:** WATCH.\n\nReason: Balanced environment leaning slightly towards buying, with stable momentum and medium volume indicating caution is warranted but not strong enough to skip entirely.",
