      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the provided data, here are the dynamic trading parameters for the Risk/SOL token:\n\n**Momentum Analysis**\n\nThe flow momentum is STABLE, indicating a balanced buying and selling pressure.\n\n**Trade Pressure Ratio**\n\nThe buy/sell ratio is 1.6, which indicates strong buying pressure.\n\n**Decision**\n\nConsidering the strong buying pressure and stable momentum, I recommend a **BUY** strategy with aggressive parameters:\n\n**BUY | Limit: -0% | TP: +20% | SL: -8% | Time: 4h**\n\nReasoning:\n\n* The token has shown consistent buying interest in recent trades, indicating a strong trend.\n* With the stable momentum and high buy/sell ratio, there's no need to wait for a bigger dip or a market order.\n* A limit order at 0% will enter near the current price, taking advantage of the strong buying pressure.\n* The take profit target is set at +20%, reflecting the high volume and liquidity.\n* The stop loss is set at -8%, providing some room to breathe in case the trade goes against us.\n\n**Volume**\n\nThe token has a moderate volume of $2,201, which falls between medium and low volume categories. This suggests that we should not be too aggressive with our entry or exit parameters.\n\n**Price Change**\n\nThe recent price change is -0.4%, indicating relatively low volatility. This supports our decision to enter near the market price rather than waiting for a bigger dip.\n\nOverall, this trade setup aims to capture the strong buying pressure and trend while managing risk with a moderate stop loss and take profit target.",

We can use -1% to -3% as our entry point, allowing for a bit of price movement before entering the market.\n3. **TAKE PROFIT:**\n\t* Volume is relatively low at $1,007, so we will take profit early with +5% to +8%.\n4. **STOP LOSS:**\n\t* Volatility is moderate, so we can use -7% to -12% as our stop loss.\n5. **TIME FRAME:**\n\t* Given the stable flow momentum and relatively low volume, we'll use a 2h to 6h time frame.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\nWATCH due to high risk of more sells than buys (Buy/Sell Ratio = 0.9) and moderate volatility.\n\nHowever, if you're still interested in taking a small position, I would recommend:\n\nBUY | Limit:-1% | TP:+5% | SL:-7% | Time:2h",
