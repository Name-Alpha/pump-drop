LIMIT ORDER:\n\n- Price Change: -6.8% (less than 50%)\n- Strong Buying Pressure: No, because the buy/sell ratio is not strongly skewed towards buys\n\nGiven that the price change is less than 50%, and there's no strong buying pressure, we can use a medium volatility parameter for the limit order.\n\n3. TAKE PROFIT:\n\n- Volume: $1,524 (less than $10k)\n\nGiven that the volume is below $10k, we should take profit at a lower percentage to capture the smaller price movements.\n\n4. STOP LOSS:\n\n- Price Change: -6.8% (low volatility)\n- Flow momentum: STABLE\n\nGiven the low price change and stable flow momentum, we can use stop loss parameters suited for low volatility.\n\n5. TIME FRAME:\n\n- Low volume: $1,524\n- Stable flow momentum: No strong trend or sudden changes indicated\n\nGiven the low volume and stable momentum, a medium time frame is suitable to capture any potential price movements without being too exposed to market fluctuations.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nBUY | Limit:-2% | TP:+5% | SL:-5% | Time:4h",

LIMIT ORDER (where to enter):\n   - Price Change: +34.9% (medium volatility)\n   - Volume: $5,317 (low volume)\n\nConsidering the medium volatility and low volume, we'll use a limit order with a slight discount to account for potential dips.\n\n3. TAKE PROFIT:\n   - Current Price: $0.00003421\n   - No specific volume threshold mentioned in the data\n\nGiven the lack of explicit volume information, I will err on the side of caution and suggest a slightly lower take profit margin to avoid over-optimism.\n\n4. STOP LOSS:\n   - Volume: $5,317 (low volume)\n\nLow volume suggests we should be cautious with our stop loss to minimize potential losses.\n\n5.
