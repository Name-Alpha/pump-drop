To take advantage of this, we'll use a conservative approach with a market order entry at 0%. The Take Profit target will be set at +7.5% to +10% due to low volume and volatility. The Stop Loss will be set at -6.9% to -8% to limit potential losses.\n\nNote: These parameters are specific to the CAT/SOL token based on the provided data.

      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the provided data and applying the dynamic trading parameters, I will analyze the token \"Orca / SOL\" as follows:\n\n1. BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM:\n\t* Ratio: 2.5 (buy/sell), which is above 1.0\n\t* Momentum: STABLE\n\t* Buying pressure is strong, but not accelerating rapidly\n\t* Therefore, a standard conservative buy strategy is suitable\n\n2. LIMIT ORDER (where to enter):\n\t* Volume: $7,426 (medium volume)\n\t* Volatility: -10.4% (low-medium volatility)\n\t* Strong buying pressure with stable momentum suggests entering near market price\n\n3. TAKE PROFIT:\n\t* Volume: $7,426 (medium volume)\n\t* Therefore, a medium take profit range is suitable\n\n4. STOP LOSS:\n\t* Volatility: -10.4% (low-medium volatility)\n\t* Therefore, a standard stop loss range is suitable\n\n5. TIME FRAME:\n\t* Momentum: STABLE\n\t* Trading volume is relatively low for this token; considering the stable momentum and low volatility, a longer time frame is more suitable.\n\nConsidering these parameters:\n\n**BUY**\n\nBUY | Limit:-0% | TP:+12% | SL:-6% | Time:4h\n\nThis suggests buying with no entry limit (market order), targeting a 12% profit, and setting a stop loss at -6%. The 4-hour time frame allows for some flexibility to adjust the position based on market movements.\n\nThe reason for this decision is that despite strong buying pressure, the token's price has been decreasing by -10.4%, indicating some risk involved. However, with stable momentum and medium volume, a standard conservative buy strategy with an appropriate stop loss and take profit range seems reasonable.\n\nPlease note that these parameters are based on the provided data and should be adapted or adjusted according to your personal trading preferences and risk tolerance.",
