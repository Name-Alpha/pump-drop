The momentum is stable, which suggests that there is no strong trend or acceleration/deceleration in the market. With low volatility and moderate volume, it's best to wait for further confirmation before entering a trade.\n\n**Dynamic Parameters**\n\nIf we were to BUY based on these parameters, here are the dynamic values:\n\n* Limit: Given the low volatility (< 10%), a conservative entry is warranted. Let's use -1% as our limit.\n* TP (Take Profit): Since the volume is moderate ($38k), let's aim for +12% as our take profit target.\n* SL (Stop Loss): With stable momentum, we can afford to be relatively tight with our stop loss. A -6% stop loss would be suitable.\n\n**Trade Parameters**\n\nBUY | Limit:-1% | TP:+12% | SL:-6% | Time:2h\n\nKeep in mind that these parameters are based on the specific data provided and may change as new information becomes available. It's essential to monitor the market closely and adjust your trading strategy accordingly.\n\n**Additional Notes**\n\n* If the token shows stronger buying pressure or a significant price increase, we can consider revising our parameters to reflect more aggressive entries.\n* Conversely, if selling activity picks up or the momentum decelerates, we may need to tighten our stop loss or wait for further confirmation before entering a trade.",

BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM:**\n\nThe buy/sell ratio is 1.2, indicating a slight bias towards buying. However, there's also a recent uptrend in buys (3 buys out of the last 5 trades). The flow momentum is STABLE, which suggests that the buying pressure isn't accelerating.\n\n**Decision:** WATCH\n\nReason: Slight buy/sell ratio imbalance and stable momentum; wait for more confirmation before entering.\n\n**2. LIMIT ORDER (where to enter):**\n\nThe price change is +0.7%, indicating low volatility (< 10%). The recent trades show a balanced ratio of buys and sells, which might indicate that the market has reached equilibrium.\n\n**Limit Order:** -X% = 0%\n\nReason: Enter near the market due to low volatility and balanced recent trades.\n\n**3. TAKE PROFIT (TP):**\n\nThe volume is $717, which is relatively low (< $3k). Therefore, we'll take profit early to avoid potential losses in case of a price drop.\n\n**Take Profit:** +Y% = 5%\n\nReason: Take profit early due to low trading volume and balanced recent trades.\n\n**4. STOP LOSS (SL):**\n\nThe recent price change is relatively stable (+0.7%), indicating low volatility. We'll set a tighter stop loss to minimize potential losses in case of a sudden price drop.\n\n**Stop Loss:** -Z% = 5%\n\nReason: Set a tighter stop loss due to low volatility and balanced recent trades.\n\n**5. TIME FRAME:**\n\nThe volume is relatively low, which might indicate that the market needs some time to establish itself.\n\n**Time Frame:** Xh = 4h\n\nReason: Use a longer time frame (4 hours) to allow for potential price stabilization.\n\n**Final Decision:** WATCH | Limit:-0% | TP:+5% | SL:-5% | Time:4h",
