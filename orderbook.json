However, considering the strong buying pressure indicated by the recent trades and stable momentum, I will enter with a 0% limit order to capture the potential trend.\n\n**TAKE PROFIT**\n\nVolume: $20,268 (< $10k, low volume)\n\nFor low volume, take profit early with a target of +5% to +10%. Given the stable momentum, I will aim for the higher end of this range, at +7.9%.\n\n**STOP LOSS**\n\nPrice Change: -9.1% (medium volatility)\nVolume: $20,268 (< $10k, low volume)\n\nFor medium volatility and low volume, a stop loss of -8% to -15% is suitable.\n\n**TIME FRAME**\n\nConsidering the stable momentum and recent buying pressure, I will choose a time frame that balances the potential for profit with the risk of a reversal. A 2h time frame seems reasonable to allow for some price movement while minimizing exposure to unexpected events.\n\nOutput:\n\nSKIP\n\nReason: More sells than buys (ratio < 1.0)",
