The limit order will enter at market price (0%), with a take profit of +8%, and a stop loss of -12%. The time frame will be 3 hours.\n\n**Reason for Decision:** Strong buying pressure and stable momentum indicate a potential uptrend, but the low volume requires caution. Entering near market with a moderate take profit and stop loss should balance risk and reward.",
