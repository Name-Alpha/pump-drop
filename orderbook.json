The recent trades show a balanced flow (55 buys and 45 sells in the last 100 trades), but with an accelerating momentum trend.\n\n* Recommendation: Aggressive buying parameters\n\n**2. LIMIT ORDER:**\nGiven the price change of +37.6% and volume of $17,188, this token is experiencing high volatility. However, the strong buying pressure (buy/sell ratio = 1.3) suggests entering near market.\n\n* Limit Order: -0% to -2%\n\n**3. TAKE PROFIT:**\nWith a volume of $17,188, this falls under medium-high volume.\n\n* Take Profit: +15% to +20%\n\n**4. STOP LOSS:**\nConsidering the high volatility and price change, we'll adjust the stop loss accordingly.\n\n* Stop Loss: -10% to -12%\n\n**5. TIME FRAME:**\nGiven the strong trend and accelerating momentum, a medium-term time frame is suitable.\n\n* Time Frame: 4h\n\n**Decision:** BUY\n\n**BUY | Limit:-0% | TP:+15% | SL:-10% | Time:4h**\n\nNote that this decision assumes you're buying at the current market price. If the token's price changes significantly before entering, adjust your limit order accordingly.\n\nAs for other possible tokens, I'll analyze some sample data and provide different dynamic parameters:\n\nToken 1 (ABC/SOL):\n* BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM: Balanced flow with decelerating momentum\n* Limit Order: -5% to -8%\n* Take Profit: +10% to +15%\n* Stop Loss: -8% to -12%\n* Time Frame: 6h\nDecision: WATCH (due to decelerating momentum)\n\nToken 2 (DEF/SOL):\n* BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM: Strong selling pressure with stable momentum\n* Limit Order: -10% to -15%\n* Take Profit: +5% to +10%\n* Stop Loss: -12% to -18%\n* Time Frame: 1day\nDecision: SKIP (high risk due to strong selling pressure)",

The momentum is STABLE, but with a slight bias towards buying (59% buys in the recent third of trades). Therefore, I will apply aggressive parameters.\n\n**Limit Order (where to enter):**\nGiven that the price change is +5.4%, which is below 50%, and considering the strong buying pressure, we can enter near market prices. However, since this is a STABLE momentum, we'll avoid entering on the absolute highest price.\n\n**Take Profit:**\nThe volume is $7,317, which falls between medium and low volumes ($3k-$10k). A suitable take profit range would be +10% to +20%.\n\n**Stop Loss:**\nConsidering the price change is relatively moderate (+5.4%), we can apply a standard stop loss.\n\n**Time Frame:**\nGiven the stable momentum and moderate volume, a 2h time frame seems suitable for this trade.\n\nWith these parameters in mind, here's the trading decision:\n\nBUY | Limit:-0% | TP:+15% | SL:-8% | Time:2h\n\nThis means entering at market prices, aiming to take profit at +15%, and setting a stop loss at -8% below the entry price. The trade will be closed after 2 hours.\n\nNote that if the momentum suddenly changes or volume increases significantly, we may need to adjust these parameters accordingly.",
