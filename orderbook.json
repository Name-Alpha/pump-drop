      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the provided data for BLOB/SOL, I will analyze and provide dynamic trading parameters.\n\n**1. BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM:**\n\nBuy/Sell Ratio: 1.2\nRecent trades (300 total): 166 buys, 134 sells\nFlow momentum: STABLE\n\nSince the buy/sell ratio is slightly above 1.0, we can consider this a balanced market with some buying pressure.\n\n**Trade Decision:** WATCH\n\nReason: While there's some buying pressure, the recent trades are relatively balanced, and the flow momentum is stable. This suggests a cautious approach rather than an immediate buy or sell decision.\n\nHowever, if I had to provide a reason for a potential BUY, it would be:\n\n**Decision:** BUY | Limit:-0% | TP:+10% | SL:-5% | Time:2h\n\nThis assumes that the buyer's momentum is accelerating and will continue. The limit order can enter at market price (0%), take profit at +10%, and set a stop loss at -5%. The time frame for this trade would be 2 hours.\n\n**Limit Order Parameters:** Since the price change is relatively low (<1%), I'll choose a conservative approach with a -0% limit order. This allows us to enter near market prices without waiting for a significant dip.\n\n**Take Profit (TP):** With medium volume ($1,321), a +10% TP seems reasonable. It provides some room for profit while not being too aggressive given the current market conditions.\n\n**Stop Loss (SL):** A -5% SL is chosen to limit potential losses in case the trade doesn't go as expected. This is relatively conservative considering the stable momentum.\n\n**Time Frame:** Given the stable momentum and medium volume, a 2-hour time frame seems appropriate for this trade.\n\nFor BLOB/SOL, I would recommend:\n\nWATCH with caution due to the balanced market conditions and stable flow momentum.",

The flow momentum is STABLE, but with an accelerating trend.\n\nParameters:\n\n* BUY/SELL RATIO: 2.0\n* FLOW MOMENTUM: ACCELERATING\n\nDecision:\nBased on the strong selling pressure and accelerating trend, I recommend **SKIP** due to high risk.\n\n2.
