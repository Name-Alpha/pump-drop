The recent 40% price increase is impressive, but not alarming. With the stable momentum and strong buying pressure, I'm willing to enter at -3% below the current market price. A take profit of +20% seems reasonable given the high volume and liquidity. However, to mitigate potential losses, a stop loss of -8% is set.\n\n**Risk Level:**\n\nModerate risk\n\n**Volume Analysis:**\n\n* Volume: $7,719 ( moderate)\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\nKeep an eye on the trade flow and momentum, as a sudden change in trend or volume could impact the token's price. Consider adjusting the stop loss if the token starts to show signs of decelerating momentum.\n\nThis decision is based solely on the provided data and should not be considered investment advice.
