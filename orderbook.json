BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM:\n\t* Ratio: 1.4 (more buys than sells), momentum: STABLE\n\t* Recommendation: WATCH with conservative parameters due to relatively balanced ratio and stable momentum.\n2. LIMIT ORDER:\n\t* Volatility: Low (< 10%), price change: +12.9%\n\t* Recommendation: Enter near market, -0% limit order.\n3. TAKE PROFIT:\n\t* Volume: $6,339 (medium), recent trades: 157 buys\n\t* Recommendation: +10% to +20% take profit due to medium volume and strong buying pressure.\n4. STOP LOSS:\n\t* Volatility: Low (< 10%)\n\t* Recommendation: -5% to -8% stop loss due to low volatility.\n\n**Combined Parameters:**\n\nBUY | Limit:-0% | TP:+15% | SL:-7% | Time:2h\n\n**Reason:** The relatively balanced buy/sell ratio and stable momentum indicate a cautious approach. Entering near the market, taking profit at +15%, and setting a stop loss at -7% should provide a reasonable risk-reward balance.\n\nHowever, considering the strong buying pressure and recent trades, it's possible to be more aggressive:\n\nBUY | Limit:-0% | TP:+20% | SL:-8% | Time:2h\n\n**Alternative Reason:** The market is showing strong buying momentum, so taking a slightly higher profit target while maintaining a relatively tight stop loss might be justified.",
