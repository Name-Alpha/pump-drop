      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the provided data, I will apply the dynamic trading parameters to make a decision.\n\n**Trade Flow Analysis**\n\nThe trade flow is STABLE, indicating a consistent buying pressure over time. However, the recent trades show a slight decrease in buying activity, which could be a warning sign.\n\n**Buy/Sell Ratio and Momentum**\n\nThe buy/sell ratio is 3.9, indicating strong buying pressure. The momentum is STABLE, but with a slight deceleration.\n\n**Volatility and Volume**\n\nThe price change is -3.2%, indicating low volatility. The volume is $7,743, which is relatively low compared to the previous trades.\n\n**Dynamic Parameters**\n\nBased on the data, I will apply the dynamic parameters as follows:\n\n1. **BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM**\n\t* Strong buying pressure (ratio > 1.5): BUY\n2. **LIMIT ORDER**\n\t* Low volatility (< 10%): -0% to +2%\n3. **TAKE PROFIT**\n\t* Medium volume ($3k-$10k): +10% to +20%\n4. **STOP LOSS**\n\t* Low volatility: -5% to -8%\n5. **TIME FRAME**\n\t* Low volume: 2h to 6h\n\n**Decision**\n\nBased on the analysis, I recommend a **BUY** with the following parameters:\n\nBUY | Limit:0% | TP:+15% | SL:-7% | Time:3h\n\nThis decision is based on the strong buying pressure and the stable momentum. The limit order will be set at market price (0%), and we can expect some growth in the next 2-6 hours. The take profit will be around +15%, and the stop loss will be set at -7% to minimize potential losses.\n\n**Reason for Decision**\n\nThe strong buying pressure and stable momentum indicate a bullish trend, making it an attractive time to enter the market. However, we must also consider the low volume and slight deceleration in trading activity, which could lead to a temporary correction. By setting a relatively tight stop loss and aiming for a 15% take profit, we can balance our risk and potential returns.\n\n**Notes**\n\nKeep in mind that this is a high-risk trade due to the low volume and slight uncertainty about future market movements. Monitor the situation closely and adjust your position or exit strategy as needed to minimize losses.",

      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the provided data, I'll analyze the token and provide dynamic trading parameters.\n\n**Momentum Analysis**\n\nThe trade flow indicates a stable momentum, which suggests a balanced buying and selling pressure. The recent trades show 5 consecutive buys, but considering the overall ratio and volume, it's not yet indicative of strong buying pressure.\n\n**Volatility Analysis**\n\nThe price change is +7.2%, which falls within the medium volatility range (10-50%). The volume is $1,693, indicating relatively low trading activity. Given these factors, we can set the limit order to enter near the market.\n\n**Limit Order**\n\nBased on the medium volatility and low trading volume, I recommend entering at a 0% (-$0) limit order. This allows us to catch any potential price movements without waiting for a bigger dip.\n\n**Take Profit (TP)**\n\nConsidering the low trading volume ($1,693), we should aim for an earlier take profit. I suggest setting the TP to +5%.\n\n**Stop Loss (SL)**\n\nThe medium volatility and stable momentum indicate a moderate stop loss range. Given these conditions, I recommend setting the SL to -8%.\n\n**Time Frame**\n\nWith low trading volume and medium volatility, we can consider a slightly longer time frame. However, considering the recent buying activity, we'll opt for a shorter time frame to capture potential price movements. Let's choose 2 hours.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on these dynamic parameters:\n\n**BUY**\n| Limit:0% | TP:+5% | SL:-8% | Time:2h |\n\nThis setup allows us to enter the market near current prices, aim for an early take profit, and set a moderate stop loss. The short time frame enables us to capture potential price movements while mitigating risks.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nWe chose to buy with conservative parameters due to:\n\n1. Balanced buying and selling pressure (stable momentum).\n2. Medium volatility, indicating some market uncertainty.\n3. Low trading volume, suggesting cautious risk management.\n4. Recent buying activity, but not yet strong enough to warrant aggressive entries.\n\nKeep in mind that these are dynamic parameters based on the specific data provided for this token.",
