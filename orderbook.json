However, with 60 buys in the recent third of trades (100 trades) and 4 buys in the last 5 trades, there's slightly more buying pressure.\n\nSince the momentum is STABLE, we'll opt for standard parameters.\n\n* Trading Pressure: WATCH (balanced market)\n2. **LIMIT ORDER**:\n\nThe price change is -11.9%, indicating medium volatility. Given the recent buying activity and balanced market, we can enter near the market.\n\n* Limit Order: 0% to -2%\n3. **TAKE PROFIT**:\n\nThe current volume is $60,398, which falls into the \"Medium Volume\" category ($3k-$10k). We'll set a relatively moderate take profit range.\n\n* Take Profit: +5% to +10%\n4. **STOP LOSS**:\n\nWith medium volatility and no extreme price fluctuations, we can set a standard stop loss range.\n\n* Stop Loss: -8% to -15%\n5. **TIME FRAME**:\n\nGiven the balanced market and moderate volume, we'll opt for a longer time frame to allow the trade to develop.\n\n* Time Frame: 2h\n\nConsidering these parameters, our decision is:\n\n**BUY | Limit:-1% | TP:+7% | SL:-12% | Time:2h**\n\nThis suggests entering at around $0.00007973 with a take profit target of +7% and a stop loss at -12%. The time frame is set to 2 hours, allowing the trade to develop.\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe AWIEN / SOL token shows balanced buying and selling pressure, with recent trades favoring buys. The momentum is stable, indicating a relatively calm market. With moderate volume and price change, we can enter near the market and aim for a moderate take profit range. A stop loss of -12% provides some room to breathe in case of unexpected price movements.",
