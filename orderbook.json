      "ai_reasoning": "**Decision:**  \n**WATCH**  \nThe given ratio of 0.5 (buys/sells) indicates more sells, which is high risk. However, the recent trades show strong buying pressure (last 10 trades all buys) and the price has increased by 11.9%, suggesting potential for further movement. The high volume ($15,346) also supports a more aggressive take-profit range. While the ratio is low, the recent activity and price momentum warrant caution rather than immediate action.\n\n---\n\n**Dynamic Parameters Based on Data:**  \n1. **Limit Order (Entry):**  \n   - **Range:** **-2% to -5%**  \n   - *Reasoning:* The price change of +11.9% falls within medium volatility (10\u201350%), so a conservative limit order is appropriate to avoid overexposure.  \n\n2. **Take Profit (TP):**  \n   - **Range:** **+20% to +40%**  \n   - *Reasoning:* High volume ($15,346) suggests strong market participation, supporting a wider profit target to capitalize on potential upward momentum.  \n\n3. **Stop Loss (SL):**  \n   - **Range:** **-15% to -25%**  \n   - *Reasoning:* High volume and the risk of a reversal due to the low ratio justify a tighter stop-loss to limit downside.  \n\n4. **Time Frame:**  \n   - **Range:** **30 minutes to 2 hours**  \n   - *Reasoning:* High volume and recent buying pressure suggest short-term opportunities, aligning with intraday trading strategies.  \n\n---\n\n**Key Considerations:**  \n- **Recent Buying Pressure:** The last 10 trades being all buys indicates a shift in sentiment, which could counterbalance the low ratio.  \n- **Price Momentum:** A 11.9% increase suggests strength, but the low ratio warns of potential reversal risks.  \n- **Volume:** High volume supports confidence in the price movement but also highlights the need for a protective stop-loss.  \n\n**Recommendation:**  \nMonitor the market closely for confirmation of the recent buying trend. Use the defined ranges for entry, stop-loss, and take-profit to manage risk while capitalizing on potential short-term gains. Adjust the strategy based on real-time price action and volume changes.",
