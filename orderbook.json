The limit order will be set at -4% to wait for a more significant dip, while the take profit and stop loss parameters are set according to the medium volume and high volatility of the token.\n\n**Reason for decision**: Balanced buying pressure with a slight bias towards selling, stable momentum, and moderate trading activity suggest caution is warranted.",
