      "ai_reasoning": "**Analysis and Decision:**\n\n1. **Buy/Sell Ratio:**  \n   The user provided a \"Buy/Sell Ratio\" of 0.9. Typically, this would mean **buys = 0.9 \u00d7 sells**, implying **more sells**. However, the trade flow data (160 buys vs. 140 sells) indicates a **buys/sells ratio of ~1.14**, which is **strong buying pressure**. This discrepancy likely stems from a user error, but the trade flow data is more concrete. Assuming the trade flow is accurate, the **buys/sells ratio is >1.0**, indicating **strong buying pressure**.\n\n2. **Price Change:**  \n   The price increased by **+170.4%**, which is **high volatility**. According to Rule 2, high volatility requires a **limit of -5% to -10%**. However, Rule 1 specifies that **strong buying pressure (ratio >1.5)** leads to **aggressive parameters**, including a **0% limit** (market order). Since the ratio is **>1.0**, but not >1.5, the **limit is adjusted to 0%** (strong buying overrides volatility in this context).\n\n3. **Take Profit (TP):**  \n   High volatility suggests a **larger TP**. A common practice is to set TP at **+20%** of the price change to account for potential reversal.\n\n4. **Stop Loss (SL):**  \n   High volatility also implies a **tighter SL**. A **-5%** stop loss balances risk and reward.\n\n5. **Timeframe:**  \n   Aggressive buying in high volatility scenarios often uses a **shorter timeframe** (e.g., 1 hour) to capitalize on momentum before potential reversals.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n**BUY | Limit:0% | TP:+20% | SL:-5% | Time:1h**",
