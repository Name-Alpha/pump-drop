However, the ratio is not sufficiently high (>1.5) to trigger a direct \"BUY\" per the rules. The stable momentum and low volume further support a cautious WATCH stance.  \n\n**Parameters:**  \n- **Limit Order:** -2% to -5% (medium volatility range)  \n- **Take Profit:** +5% to +10% (low volume)  \n- **Stop Loss:** -8% to -15% (medium volatility)  \n- **Time Frame:** 2h to 6h (standard for stable momentum)  \n\nThis approach balances caution with the observed buying momentum, avoiding overcommitment while remaining responsive to potential trend continuation.",
