We'll opt for a conservative entry with a -3% limit order to avoid potential false breakouts. The take profit target will be +7%, considering the low volume and medium volatility. The stop loss will be at -10%, which is standard for medium volatility. Finally, we'll use a 6h time frame to capture the trend.\n\n**Note**\n\nKeep in mind that these parameters are specific to this token's data and may not be applicable to other tokens or trading situations.
