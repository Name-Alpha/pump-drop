Additionally, with medium volatility and low volume, it's better to wait for a clearer trend or further confirmation before entering the market.\n\nIf you decide to enter the market after reassessment, here are the dynamic parameters:\n\n**BUY**\n\n* Limit: -2% (conservative entry point)\n* TP: +5% (take profit early due to low volume)\n* SL: -8% (standard stop loss range for medium volatility)\n\nTime frame: 2h to 4h",
