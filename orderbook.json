      "ai_reasoning": "**Analysis and Decision:**\n\n1. **Buy/Sell Ratio:**  \n   The user provided a ratio of **1.5**, which falls within the **balanced range (1.0\u20131.5)**. However, the recent trade data (145 buys vs. 155 sells) suggests a **slight edge to sells** (ratio \u2248 0.935), which contradicts the given ratio. This discrepancy introduces ambiguity. Assuming the user intended the **1.5 ratio**, it would fall into the **balanced** category, suggesting **conservative buying** or **watching**. If the actual ratio (0.935) is correct, it would imply **more sells**, aligning with the **SKIP/Watch** category.\n\n2. **Momentum:**  \n   The trade flow momentum is **stable**, which typically suggests **standard parameters** for decision-making.\n\n3. **Price Change:**  \n   A **+10.3% price change** indicates **medium volatility**. For medium volatility, the **limit order** should be set at **-2% to -5%**, but if the ratio is **strong buying**, the limit defaults to **0% (market order)**.\n\n4. **Volume:**  \n   The volume is **$3,883**, which is **low**. For low volume, **take profit** is **+5% to +10%**, and **stop loss** is **-5% to -8%**.\n\n5. **Time Frame:**  \n   Low volume suggests a **shorter time frame** of **2h to 6h**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Decision:**  \nGiven the **conflicting data** (1.5 ratio vs. actual 0.935), the **most conservative approach** is to **WATCH** the market. If the **1.5 ratio** is accurate (strong buying), then **BUY** with aggressive parameters. However, due to the **recent trade data**, the **actual ratio** (0.935) implies **more sells**, which would lean toward **SKIP**. \n\n**Recommendation:**  \n**WATCH** the market to confirm the ratio and momentum before committing to a trade. If the ratio is confirmed as **>1.5**, proceed with **BUY** using the aggressive parameters. Otherwise, **avoid trading** until clarity is achieved.\n\n---\n\n**Answer:**  \n**WATCH** the market. If the ratio is confirmed as >1.5, proceed with **BUY** at 0% limit, +5% to +10% take profit, -5% to -8% stop loss, and a 2h to 6h time frame. Otherwise, avoid trading.",
