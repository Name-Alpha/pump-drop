However, the recent trades (300 total) show **150 buys and 150 sells**, which balances the ratio. This discrepancy might stem from conflicting data sources, but we'll prioritize the recent trade data (150/150) for decision-making.\n\n2. **Price Change (+2.3%):**  \n   Low volatility, so **limit order** is set at **0% to -2%** (near market entry).\n\n3. **Volume ($9,565):**  \n   Low volume, so **take profit** is **+5% to +10%**, and **stop loss** is **-5% to -8%**.\n\n4. **Trade Flow (Stable):**  \n   The stable flow suggests no immediate trend reversal, supporting a cautious approach.\n\n5. **Time Frame:**  \n   Low volume warrants a **2-hour to 6-hour** holding period.\n\n**Final Decision:**  \nDespite the conflicting ratio data, the **recent trades** show balance, and the **stable flow** suggests a potential setup for a **BUY**. However, the **high-risk ratio** (0.8) introduces caution. To mitigate risk, we'll proceed with a **BUY** but with **strict stop-loss** and **take-profit** parameters.\n\n**Action:**  \n**BUY** with a **limit order at 0%** (near current price), **stop-loss at -5%**, and **take-profit at +10%**. Monitor for 2\u20136 hours, and reassess based on price action.  \n\n**Answer:**  \nBUY with a limit order at 0%, stop-loss at -5%, and take-profit at +10%. Hold for 2\u20136 hours.",
