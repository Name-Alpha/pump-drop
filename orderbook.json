However, the recent trend of 4 buys in the previous 5 trades suggests a potential reversal. To be cautious, it's best to watch this token before entering.\n\n**Parameter Settings:**\n\n* Limit Order: -2% (near market entry due to low volatility)\n* Take Profit: +10% (medium volume, conservative TP)\n* Stop Loss: -8% (medium volatility, standard SL)\n\n**Why not BUY?**\nThe balanced buy/sell ratio and stable momentum suggest that the token is currently in a neutral state. With only 3 buys in the last 5 trades, it's possible that the market is about to reverse.\n\n**Why not SKIP?**\nThe volume is relatively high ($10,796), and there's no indication of any significant issues with the token. Watching this token may be beneficial for further analysis before making a decision.\n\nKeep in mind that these parameters are dynamic and based on specific data. Always adjust your trading strategy according to your own risk tolerance and market conditions.",

Given strong buying pressure, we can enter near market with a market order, so no need for a limit order.\n\n3. **TAKE PROFIT:**\nWith a medium volume of $571, the take profit range should be between +10% to +20%.\n\n4. **STOP LOSS:**\nGiven low volatility and stable momentum, the stop loss range should be -5% to -8%.\n\n5. **TIME FRAME:**\nSince there's no clear trend or high volatility, a standard time frame of 2h to 6h is suitable.\n\n**Decision**\n\nWATCH with reason: \"Balanced buy/sell ratio and stable momentum indicate a cautious approach.\"\n\nIf you still want to consider a BUY strategy, here are the parameters:\n\nBUY | Limit:-0% | TP:+15% | SL:-7% | Time:3h\n\nHowever, given the balanced market conditions, I would recommend a WATCH strategy for now.",
