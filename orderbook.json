We'll choose 2h.\n\n**Decision**\n\nBased on the analysis, I recommend:\n\n**WATCH** (due to more sells than buys and low volume)\n\nBrief reason: The token has more sells than buys, indicating potential selling pressure. Additionally, the volume is relatively low, which may lead to larger price movements. It's better to wait for a clearer trend before entering.\n\nHowever, if you still want to buy, here are some dynamic parameters:\n\n**BUY**\n\nBUY | Limit:-2% | TP:+7% | SL:-12% | Time:2h",
