Therefore:\n\n**BUY | Limit:-2% | TP:+10% | SL:-8% | Time:4h**\n\nThis decision balances the risk of entering at a lower price with the potential reward from a strong buying signal and relatively low volatility compared to other tokens.\n\nNote: Always remember that these parameters are based on specific data for this token (ika/SOL) and may not be universally applicable. Continuous monitoring and adaptation according to changing market conditions are crucial in trading decisions.",
