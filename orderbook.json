      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the provided data, I will analyze the Pika/SOL token and provide dynamic trading parameters.\n\n**Buying Pressure & Momentum:**\nThe buy/sell ratio is 1.3, which indicates a slight bias towards buying. However, there are more sells than buys in the recent trades (128 sells vs 172 buys). This suggests that the momentum is decelerating, indicating a wait-and-see approach.\n\n**Momentum Analysis:**\nFlow momentum is labeled as STABLE, but considering the recent trade flow, I will interpret it as decelerating.\n\nBased on these observations, I recommend:\n\n* **WATCH**: The token has a slightly higher buying pressure than selling, but the recent trade flow indicates a deceleration in momentum. It's essential to wait for a more significant dip before entering this market.\n\n**Limit Order:**\nSince the price change is -8.9%, which falls under low volatility (< 10%), we can enter near the market price with a limit order.\n\n**Take Profit:**\nWith a volume of $6,994 (medium), I recommend:\n\n* **TP:+12%**\n\n**Stop Loss:**\nConsidering the decelerating momentum and medium volatility, I suggest:\n\n* **SL:-10%**\n\n**Time Frame:**\nGiven the low volatility and decelerating momentum, I recommend a longer time frame to allow for more significant price movements.\n\n* **Time:4h**\n\nHere is the formatted decision:\nWATCH | Limit:0% | TP:+12% | SL:-10% | Time:4h",

      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the provided data and dynamic trading parameters, here's the analysis for BUNKER / SOL:\n\n**Momentum Analysis:**\n\n* Trade Flow: STABLE momentum, indicating no significant acceleration or deceleration in buying or selling pressure.\n\n**Buy/Sell Pressure & Momentum:**\n\n* Buy/Sell Ratio: 1.5 (balanced), indicating a slight bias towards buys.\n* Recent trades: 4 buys out of the last 5 trades, suggesting accelerating buying pressure.\n\n**Limit Order:**\n\n* Price Change: -3.1% (low volatility), making it a good time to enter near market prices.\n* Strong buying pressure: since the ratio is above 1.0 and recent trades are biased towards buys, we can consider entering at market prices.\n\n**Take Profit:**\n\n* Volume: $5,107 (medium volume), suggesting a take profit range of +10% to +20%.\n\n**Stop Loss:**\n\n* Volatility: low (-3.1%), indicating a stop loss range of -5% to -8%.\n\n**Time Frame:**\n\n* Low volatility and stable momentum suggest a time frame of 2h to 6h, allowing for some price movement without excessive risk.\n\nConsidering these parameters, the trading decision is:\n\n**BUY | Limit:0% | TP:+15% | SL:-7% | Time:4h**\n\nReasoning:\nThe token exhibits balanced buy/sell pressure and stable momentum. The recent trades suggest accelerating buying pressure, making it a good time to enter. With medium volume and low volatility, we can aim for a take profit of +15%. A stop loss of -7% provides adequate room for price fluctuations.\n\n**Note:** Since the trading parameters are dynamic and based on specific data, they may change as new information becomes available. Always keep in mind that these parameters should be adjusted according to your personal risk tolerance and market conditions.",
