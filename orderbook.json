      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the provided data, I'll analyze the Wojalien token and provide dynamic trading parameters.\n\n**Momentum Analysis:**\nThe Buy/Sell Ratio is 1.2, which indicates a slightly higher buying pressure compared to selling. The Flow Momentum is STABLE, indicating no significant acceleration or deceleration in trading activity.\n\n**Trading Parameters:**\n\n1. **BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM:**\n\t* Since the ratio is above 1.0 ( Buy/Sell Ratio = 1.2), we don't have a strong selling pressure.\n\t* With STABLE momentum, we'll use standard parameters for this token.\n2. **LIMIT ORDER:**\n\t* The price change is +42.5%, indicating high volatility. However, the recent trades show a balanced buying and selling activity (3 buys in the last 5 trades).\n\t* We'll set the limit order to -2% to account for potential dips while still entering near the market.\n3. **TAKE PROFIT:**\n\t* The volume is relatively low at $26,116. Therefore, we'll use lower take-profit levels.\n\t* +10% to +15% should be a suitable range for taking profits on this token.\n4. **STOP LOSS:**\n\t* With high volatility and balanced trading activity, we'll set a slightly tighter stop-loss range.\n\t* -8% to -12% seems reasonable for this token.\n5. **TIME FRAME:**\n\t* The low volume and STABLE momentum suggest using a medium-term time frame.\n\t* We'll use 2h as the initial time frame.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nGiven these parameters, I recommend:\n\nBUY | Limit:-2% | TP:+12% | SL:-10% | Time:2h\n\nThis decision is based on the standard parameters for this token's specific data. Monitor the market closely and adjust the parameters if needed to adapt to changing conditions.\n\n**Risk Note:** Trading with a stop-loss of -10% may be considered high-risk for some traders. Adjust the stop-loss level according to your personal risk tolerance and trading strategy.",

      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the provided data, I will output dynamic trading parameters for the FTX/SOL token.\n\n**Momentum Analysis**\nThe Flow momentum is STABLE, indicating a balanced buying and selling pressure. However, upon closer inspection of recent trades, there are more sells than buys (144 sells vs 156 buys), which suggests a slight imbalance in favor of selling. This might indicate a short-term bearish trend or caution against overbought conditions.\n\n**Dynamic Parameters**\n\n1. **BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM**\nGiven the balanced momentum but with slightly more sells, I will apply conservative parameters.\n   - Ratio: 0.93 (more sells than buys)\n   - Pressure: WATCH\n\n2. **LIMIT ORDER (where to enter)**\n- Volatility: $40,298 volume is considered medium, and the price change is -75.9%, indicating high volatility.\n- Entry: -5% to -10% for a safer entry point considering the significant drop.\n\n3. **TAKE PROFIT**\nGiven the low volume of recent trades, it's advisable to set take profit early.\n   - Volume: Low ($40,298)\n   - TP: +5% to +10%\n\n4. **STOP LOSS**\nConsidering high volatility, setting a stop loss at a relatively safe distance is prudent.\n   - Volatility: High (-75.9%)\n   - SL: -12% to -18%\n\n5. **TIME FRAME**\nHigh volatility and recent strong selling pressure suggest trading with a shorter time frame for quick adjustments.\n   - Time Frame: 30min\n\n**Trading Decision**\n\nGiven these parameters, the decision is:\n**WATCH (Potential Dip)**\n\nReason: The token shows signs of a short-term bearish trend or caution against overbought conditions. It's advisable to wait and observe potential dips before entering with aggressive parameters.\n\n**Note:** Always keep in mind that trading decisions should be based on your personal risk tolerance, financial situation, and market analysis beyond just these rules.",

The take profit is set at +12%, and the stop loss is -20%. With a time frame of 4 hours, this trade should allow for some room to breathe while still taking advantage of the uptrend.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe token has shown strong buying pressure, with 1.9 times more buys than sells. The high volatility indicates that the price can move quickly, but the stable momentum suggests a trend is forming. A -5% to -10% limit order would be too conservative given the strong uptrend, so we opt for a -8% entry point. With a medium volume and price change above 50%, we set the take profit at +12% to +20%. The stop loss should be wide enough to accommodate potential corrections, so we set it at -20%.\n\nNote that these parameters are specific to this token based on the provided data and may not apply to other tokens.",
