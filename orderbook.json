With low volatility and medium volume, it's a good time to enter the market near current prices. The stop loss is set at -5% to give some room for price fluctuation, while the take profit is set at +10% to capture some of the potential upside.\n\n**Note**\n\nAs this is a relatively stable token with balanced buy/sell pressure, it's essential to monitor the situation closely and adjust parameters as needed. If momentum accelerates or decelerates, parameters may need to be adjusted accordingly.",
