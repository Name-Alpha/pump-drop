      "ai_reasoning": "**BUY | Limit:0% | TP:+10% | SL:-10% | Time:2h-6h**\n\n---\n\n### **Explanation of Parameters:**\n\n1. **Decision: BUY**  \n   - The trade is recommended due to strong buying pressure (buying ratio of 3.0 > 1.5), indicating potential upward momentum.\n\n2. **Limit: 0%**  \n   - For strong buying pressure, the rule specifies entering the trade at the current price (0% limit), as the market is likely to move upward immediately.\n\n3. **Take Profit: +10%**  \n   - The trade is expected to close at a 10% gain, which is the upper end of the range for low-volume conditions (5%\u201310%). This accounts for potential price movement in a low-liquidity environment.\n\n4. **Stop Loss: -10%**  \n   - The stop loss is set at -10%, reflecting the middle of the range for medium-volatility conditions (-8% to -15%). This balances risk and reward while allowing room for short-term fluctuations.\n\n5. **Time Frame: 2h-6h**  \n   - The time frame is determined by the low volume, which suggests a slower, more range-bound movement. The range (2h\u20136h) allows for flexibility in capturing the trade without overexposure to volatility.\n\n---\n\nThis strategy is optimized for a low-volume, medium-volatility environment, with a focus on capturing short-term gains while managing risk through a clear stop-loss and take-profit structure.",
