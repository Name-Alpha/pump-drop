      "ai_reasoning": "After analyzing the provided data, here are the dynamic trading parameters for the CAGE token:\n\n**Token-specific rules:**\n\n1. **Buy/Sell Pressure & Momentum:** The buy/sell ratio is 1.3, which indicates balanced buying pressure. However, considering the recent trades show 2 buys and no sells in the last 5 trades, we can infer that there's a slight bias towards buying.\n\t* Since it's not strong buying (> 1.5), nor extremely imbalanced (ratio < 1.0), the momentum is considered stable.\n\t* **Standard parameters:**\n2. **Limit Order (where to enter):** The price change is +5.3%, which is within the medium volatility range (10-50%).\n\t* Considering the low volume and slightly balanced buying pressure, it's best to enter near market with a slight correction.\n\t* **-1% to -2% (enter near market)**\n3. **Take Profit:** The current price is $0.00011115, and the trading volume is $7,330, which falls under the low-volume category (< $3k).\n\t* Given the limited liquidity, it's essential to take profit early.\n\t* **+5% to +10% (take profit early)**\n4. **Stop Loss:** The current volatility is medium, with a price change of +5.3%.\n\t* Considering the trading volume and buying pressure, we can set a tighter stop loss.\n\t* **-8% to -12% (room for slight correction)**\n5. **Time Frame:** Given the low volume and balanced buying pressure, it's best to use a shorter time frame.\n\t* **1h to 2h**\n\nBased on these dynamic parameters:\n\n**BUY | Limit:-1% | TP:+7% | SL:-9% | Time:1h**\n\nNote that I've adjusted the stop loss slightly tighter than initially considered due to the balanced buying pressure and medium volatility. However, this is still a relatively cautious approach given the low volume and recent price action.\n\nIf you'd like me to revise any of these parameters or consider additional data points, please let me know!",
