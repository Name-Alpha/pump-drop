      "ai_reasoning": "After analyzing the provided data, I'll generate dynamic trading parameters based on the specific rules and data points. Please note that these parameters are tailored to the CYBERDENG/SOL token.\n\n**BUY Parameters:**\n\nGiven the strong buying pressure (ratio > 1.5), accelerating momentum, and low volatility (< 10%), I recommend:\n\nBUY | Limit: -0% (Market Order) | TP: +15% | SL: -5% | Time: 2h\n\nThese parameters take into account the strong buying pressure, allowing for a market entry, while setting an aggressive target profit to capitalize on the momentum. The stop-loss is set at a reasonable -5%, considering the low volatility.\n\n**Reasoning:** The token has shown consistent buying pressure in all thirds of the trade flow, indicating a strong trend. The accelerating momentum suggests that the price will continue to rise. With low volatility and no significant dips, it's best to enter the market with a market order and set an aggressive target profit.\n\n**Note:** If the volume increases above $10k, I would recommend adjusting the take-profit to +20% to +40% (more liquidity to exit) and keeping the stop-loss at -5%.",
