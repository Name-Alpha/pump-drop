I will enter at -3% below the current price to account for some volatility and potential dips. The take profit target is set at +7%, and the stop loss is at -12%. Given the stable momentum, I will use a 2-hour time frame.\n\n**Note:**\n\n* If the trade flow momentum were accelerating or decelerating, I would adjust the parameters accordingly.\n* If the volume increased significantly (e.g., > $10k), I would consider more aggressive take profit targets and tighter stop losses.",
