We're entering at a -5% limit order to wait for a bigger dip, taking profit at +7%, and setting a stop loss at -10%. The time frame is set to 4 hours, which should give us enough time to ride the trend.\n\nPlease note that this analysis is based on the provided data and rules.

With stable momentum and recent trades indicating buying pressure, we'll consider a standard BUY strategy.\n2. **LIMIT ORDER (where to enter)**\n\t* Volatility: Moderate (+24.5% price change). We'll set the entry point at -2% to -5%.\n3. **TAKE PROFIT**\n\t* Volume: $4,178 is below our threshold of $10k for high volume. We'll set a moderate take profit range.\n4. **STOP LOSS**\n\t* Volatility: Moderate. We'll set a standard stop loss range.\n5. **TIME FRAME**\n\t* Momentum: STABLE, and we don't see any strong trend indicators. We'll choose a time frame based on the trade flow.\n\n**Recommendation**\n\nBased on these parameters:\n\nBUY | Limit:-3% | TP:+10% | SL:-8% | Time:2h\n\nThe BUY signal is triggered due to stable momentum and moderate buying pressure. The entry point is set at -3% to avoid chasing the price and give some room for correction. A take profit of +10% is reasonable considering the moderate volume, while a stop loss of -8% provides some buffer against potential losses.\n\n**Notes**\n\n* As there are no recent buys in the last 5 trades, we'll keep an eye on this indicator for potential trend reversal.\n* With stable momentum and moderate volatility, this trade might not be as aggressive as those with strong buying pressure or high volume.",
