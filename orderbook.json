The recent trades show a shift towards buying (3 buys in the last 5 trades). The flow momentum is STABLE, indicating no significant acceleration or deceleration.\n\n* BUY/SELL RATIO: 1.5\n* MOMENTUM: STABLE\n\nBased on these parameters:\n\n**Decision:** BUY\n\n**Parameters:**\n\nBUY | Limit:-0% (market order) | TP:+15% | SL:-8% | Time:4h\n\nExplanation:\nWith strong buying pressure and stable momentum, we can enter the market with a limit price of 0%, as there's no need to wait for a dip. The take profit is set at +15%, given the low volume and stable price action. The stop loss is set at -8% to limit potential losses.\n\n**Alternative:**\nIf you prefer to be more conservative, you can consider WATCH with the following parameters:\n\nWATCH | High buying pressure, but stable momentum\n\nThis will allow you to monitor the situation further before entering a trade.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n* The current price of $0.00001783 is relatively low compared to the recent trades.\n* The volume of $8,599 may not be sufficient for aggressive trading, but it's still above $3k, which justifies a take profit of +10% to +20%.\n* Keep an eye on the price action and adjust your parameters accordingly.\n\nPlease note that these parameters are dynamic and based on specific data. It's essential to continuously monitor the market and adjust your strategy as needed.",

Therefore:\n\n* Limit: -3%\n\n**Take Profit**\n\nThe volume of $2,926 is considered low (< $3k). Hence:\n\n* TP: +5%\n\n**Stop Loss**\n\nGiven the low volatility and relatively stable momentum, we'll set a tighter SL:\n\n* SL: -8%\n\n**Time Frame**\n\nConsidering the low volume and stable momentum, we'll opt for a shorter time frame:\n\n* Time: 2h\n\nBased on these parameters, here's the decision:\n\nBUY | Limit:-3% | TP:+5% | SL:-8% | Time:2h",
