The limit order is set at -7% to wait for a bigger dip, considering the high volatility of the token. The take profit is set at +6%, which is relatively low due to the very low volume. The stop loss is set at -20%, providing room to breathe in case of further price decline.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nThe analysis indicates that the token has strong buying pressure, but its low trading volume and high price change make it a high-risk investment. Therefore, the parameters are set with caution, assuming that the price will rebound after a bigger dip. If the momentum changes or the price continues to decline, it is best to reassess the situation and adjust the trading parameters accordingly.\n\n**Alternative Options**\n\nIf you are unsure about the trade setup, you can consider watching the token with the following parameters:\n\nWATCH: Strong buying pressure and high volatility make this a potential trap; wait for more data to confirm the trend.\n\nOr, if you want to skip the trade altogether:\n\nSKIP: The low trading volume and high price change indicate that this token is not suitable for trading.",
