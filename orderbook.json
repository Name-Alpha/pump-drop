However, with a strong buy/sell ratio and recent trades showing more buys than sells, there's an indication of accelerating momentum.\n\n**Rule-Based Parameters:**\n\n1. **BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM:**\n\t* Strong buying pressure (ratio > 1.5) with accelerating momentum, so we'll opt for a **BUY**.\n2. **LIMIT ORDER (where to enter):**\n\t* With strong buying pressure and recent trades showing buys, it's likely that the price will continue to rise. Therefore, we can consider entering at market (0%).\n3. **TAKE PROFIT:**\n\t* Medium volume ($4k), so we'll aim for a moderate take profit range.\n4. **STOP LOSS:**\n\t* Low volatility (< 10%) and stable momentum, so we'll set a tighter stop loss range.\n5. **TIME FRAME:**\n\t* With accelerating momentum and strong buying pressure, we'll consider a shorter time frame to capture potential gains.\n\n**Dynamic Trading Parameters for Komomo (SOL):**\n\nBUY | Limit:0% | TP:+15% | SL:-6% | Time:1h\n\nThe parameters above are based on the analysis of the current situation and the token's specific data. The buy limit is set to 0%, indicating a market order, as there's strong buying pressure and accelerating momentum. The take profit range is +15%, reflecting the medium volume and moderate expectation for price increase. The stop loss is -6%, which is tighter than usual due to low volatility and stable momentum.\n\n**Decision:** BUY\n\nThese parameters are designed to capture potential gains while minimizing risks, given the strong buying pressure and accelerating momentum in the Komomo token.",
