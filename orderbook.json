Let's set the TP at **+5%**.\n* **STOP LOSS**: Considering low volatility (-3.1%), a more conservative SL is suitable. We'll set the SL at **-8%**.\n* **TIME FRAME**: For low volume and stable momentum, let's use a 2h time frame.\n\nHere is the decision:\n\nBUY | Limit:0% | TP:+5% | SL:-8% | Time:2h\n\nThis means buying Orca (SOL) with no limit order, setting a take profit at +5%, and a stop loss at -8%. The trade will be open for 2 hours.\n\n**Reasoning**: The strong buying pressure indicates a bullish trend, but low volume and stable momentum suggest caution. We're taking advantage of the market's current favorability while being prepared for potential reversals with a moderate take profit and stop loss.",
