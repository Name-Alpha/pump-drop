The recent trades also show a trend of buys over sells. Given the high volatility and strong buying pressure, we can enter the market with a market order (limit: -0%). With a high volume of $3,676, there's room for growth, so we set our take profit at +20%. As a precautionary measure, we'll set a stop loss at -10% to account for potential price fluctuations.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nBUY | Limit:-0% | TP:+20% | SL:-10% | Time:2h",
