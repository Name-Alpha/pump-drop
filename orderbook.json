However, the recent trades (3 buys in the last 5, 4 buys in the previous 5) and the stable trade flow suggest strong buying pressure. This, combined with the price change of 35.4% (medium volatility), aligns with the threshold for \"strong buying\" in the rules. Thus, the decision to **BUY** with aggressive parameters is appropriate.  \n\n**Parameters:**  \n- **Limit Order:** -2% to -5% (medium volatility)  \n- **Take Profit:** +10% to +20% (medium volume)  \n- **Stop Loss:** -8% to -15% (medium volatility)  \n- **Time Frame:** 4h to 1day (strong trend implied by sustained buying pressure)  \n\n**Final Answer:**  \nBUY with a limit order of -2% to -5%, take profit at +10% to +20%, stop loss at -8% to -15%, and a time frame of 4h to 1day.  \n\n**Answer:**  \nBUY with parameters: Limit Order -2% to -5%, Take Profit +10% to +20%, Stop Loss -8% to -15%, Time Frame 4h to 1day.",
