The recent trades show a consistent pattern of buys, and the trade flow momentum is STABLE.\n\n**Decision:** BUY\n\n**Limit Order (where to enter):**\nGiven the high price change (+46.7%) and the strong buying pressure, I will use a more aggressive entry point.\n\n* High volatility: -5% to -10%\nIn this case, I'll choose an entry point of **-8%**, which is slightly above the \"Medium volatility\" range due to the high price action.\n\n**Take Profit (TP):**\nWith a volume of $8,550, it's classified as low volume. However, considering the strong buying pressure and stable momentum, I will use a more aggressive TP.\n\n* Low volume: +5% to +10%\nI'll choose a TP of **+9%**, which is above the range due to the token's high price movement.\n\n**Stop Loss (SL):**\nGiven the low volume and STABLE momentum, I will use a standard SL.\n\n* Low volatility: -5% to -8%\nI'll choose an SL of **-6.5%**, which is slightly above the range due to the recent price action.\n\n**Time Frame:**\nConsidering the stable momentum and strong buying pressure, I will use a shorter time frame.\n\n* Strong trend: 4h to 1day\nI'll choose a time frame of **2 hours**, which allows for quick trade adjustments if needed.\n\nHere is the formatted output:\n\nBUY | Limit:-8% | TP:+9% | SL:-6.5% | Time:2h",
