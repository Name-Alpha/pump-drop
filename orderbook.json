      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the provided data, I will analyze the Starstar/SOL token and provide dynamic trading parameters.\n\n**Current Analysis:**\n\n* The current price is $0.00000971.\n* Volume is $2,513, which is considered low volume.\n* Buy/Sell Ratio is 1.2, indicating balanced buying pressure.\n* Recent trades show 174 buys and 126 sells, with a 2-buy/5-buy pattern in the last two sets of trades.\n* The trade flow indicates stable momentum.\n\n**Dynamic Parameters:**\n\n1. **BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM:**\n\t* Since the buy/sell ratio is 1.2 (balanced), we will use \"WATCH\" parameters. There's no strong buying pressure or accelerating momentum, so conservative parameters are suitable.\n2. **LIMIT ORDER (where to enter):**\n\t* Given the low volume (< $3k) and stable momentum, we'll enter near market with a limit order at 0% (-$0.00000971).\n3. **TAKE PROFIT:**\n\t* With low volume, we'll take profit early with +5% (+$0.000000485) target.\n4. **STOP LOSS:**\n\t* Considering the low volatility (< 10%), we'll set a stop loss at -5% (-$0.000000485).\n5. **TIME FRAME:**\n\t* Given the stable momentum and low volume, we'll use a 2h time frame.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\nBUY | Limit: 0% | TP:+5% | SL:-5% | Time:2h\n\nThis decision is based on the balanced buying pressure, stable momentum, and conservative parameters suitable for a token with low volume. The limit order at 0% allows us to enter near market, while the +5% take profit target provides an early exit. The -5% stop loss offers some room to breathe in case of price fluctuations.\n\nPlease note that this is a dynamic analysis based on the provided data and should not be considered investment advice. It's essential to continuously monitor the token's performance and adjust parameters accordingly.",

We will enter near market price with a small dip.\n3. **TAKE PROFIT:**\n\t* The volume is $13,273, which falls in the medium volume category. We will set our take profit to +10% to +20%.\n4. **STOP LOSS:**\n\t* With low volatility and stable momentum, we can set a relatively tight stop loss of -5% to -8%.\n\n**Time Frame:** Given the balanced momentum and low volatility, we can trade with a time frame of 2h to 6h.\n\nConsidering these parameters, here is our decision:\n\n**BUY | Limit:-1.0% | TP:+15% | SL:-7.0% | Time:3h**\n\nThis setup allows us to enter the market near the current price, take profit at a reasonable level, and set a relatively tight stop loss while still allowing some room for volatility.\n\nNote that if the momentum were to accelerate or decelerate, we would adjust our parameters accordingly based on the updated conditions.",
