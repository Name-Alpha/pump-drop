Let's use a more conservative approach and set it to +5%.\n4. **Stop Loss:**\n\t* Price change: +8.7% (medium volatility)\n\t* For medium volatility, the stop loss should be set to -8% to -15%. Given that there are more sells than buys, we'll err on the side of caution and use a tighter stop loss of **-10%**.\n5. **Time Frame:**\n\t* Flow momentum: STABLE\n\t* Since the flow momentum is stable, we can use a standard time frame of **4h to 1day**.\n\nConsidering these parameters, our decision for the Frat token is:\n\nWATCH (high risk due to more sells than buys)\n\nHowever, if you still want to consider a trade with these parameters, here's what it would look like:\n\nWATCH | Limit:-3% | TP:+5% | SL:-10% | Time:4h",

Considering the strong buying pressure, a more aggressive entry point is suitable. Therefore:\n\t* Limit: -0% (market order)\n3. **TAKE PROFIT**\n\t* Volume is relatively low ($1,060), which suggests taking profit early. However, considering the price change and momentum, a slightly higher take-profit target can be applied.\n\t* TP: +8% to +12%\n4. **STOP LOSS**\n\t* Volatility is relatively low (< 10%), so a tighter stop-loss is acceptable.\n\t* SL: -5% to -7%\n5. **TIME FRAME**\n\t* Considering the strong trend and low volume, a longer time frame is suitable for this trade.\n\t* Time: 4h\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nGiven these dynamic parameters:\n\nBUY | Limit:-0% | TP:+10% | SL:-6% | Time:4h",
