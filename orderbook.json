However, since the recent trades show 4 buys in the last 5 trades, we may see accelerating buying pressure soon.\n\n**Limit Order:**\n\n* Price change: +37.2% (medium volatility)\n* Buying pressure: accelerating\n\nBased on rule 2, for medium volatility and accelerating buying pressure, the limit order should be entered near market prices with a slight dip. Let's set the entry price at -1% to -2%.\n\n**Take Profit:**\n\n* Volume: $21,157 (low volume)\n\nAccording to rule 3, for low volume, we take profit early at +5% to +10%. Let's set the target profit at +8%.\n\n**Stop Loss:**\n\n* Price change: +37.2% (medium volatility)\n* Volatility: medium\n\nBased on rule 4, for medium volatility and stable momentum, a stop loss of -8% to -12% is reasonable. Let's set the stop loss at -10%.\n\n**Time Frame:**\n\n* Volume: $21,157 (low volume)\n\nAccording to rule 5, for low volume, we use a time frame of 2h to 6h. Given the stable momentum and accelerating buying pressure, let's set the time frame at 3h.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nBUY | Limit:-1% | TP:+8% | SL:-10% | Time:3h\n\nThe recommendation is to buy Caesar/SOL with a limit order of -1%, target profit of +8%, stop loss of -10%, and a time frame of 3h.",

The time frame is 4 hours.\n\n**Reasoning**\n\nThe FUXKING token has shown balanced buying pressure and stable flow momentum. While the volume is low, the price change is moderate (+7.1%). Given these factors, we can consider entering near market price with a standard take profit range.",
