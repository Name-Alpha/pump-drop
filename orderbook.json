The token's low volume and stable momentum suggest caution before entering.\n\nHowever, considering the strong buying pressure in recent trades, a more aggressive entry might be warranted. If you're comfortable with the risk, consider:\n\n**BUY | Limit:0% | TP:+8% | SL:-7% | Time:3h**\n\nPlease note that these parameters are based on the provided data and may not reflect your personal trading strategy or risk tolerance.

      "ai_reasoning": "After analyzing the data for LBC/SOL token, I will provide dynamic trading parameters based on the specific data:\n\n**Token:** LBC/SOL\n**Current Price:** $0.00001902\n**Volume:** $2,877\n**Buy/Sell Ratio:** 1.2 ( slightly balanced)\n**Price Change:** +22.6% (high volatility)\n\nBased on the data, here are my recommendations for trading parameters:\n\n* **Momentum:** STABLE (no strong buying or selling pressure)\n* **Buy/Sell Pressure & Momentum:**\n\t+ Balanced buy/sell ratio of 1.2\n\t+ No strong acceleration or deceleration in momentum\n* **Limit Order (where to enter):**\n\t+ High volatility, so wait for a bigger dip: -5% to -10%\n* **Take Profit:**\n\t+ Medium volume ($3k-$10k), so set a moderate TP: +10% to +20%\n* **Stop Loss:**\n\t+ Low volatility, but still some room to breathe: -5% to -8%\n* **Time Frame:**\n\t+ Stable momentum and medium volume, so trade in 2h to 6h time frame\n\n**Decision:** WATCH\nReason: The token has a balanced buy/sell ratio and stable momentum. With high volatility, it's better to wait for a bigger dip before entering.\n\nHowever, if you want to take an aggressive approach (not recommended), here are the dynamic trading parameters:\n\n**Format:** BUY | Limit:-X% | TP:+Y% | SL:-Z% | Time:Xh\n\n* **BUY | Limit:-7.5% | TP:+15% | SL:-6.5% | Time:2h**\n\nThis aggressive entry will take advantage of the high volatility and balanced buy/sell ratio. However, be cautious as this approach carries higher risk.\n\nPlease note that these parameters are based on the specific data provided for LBC/SOL token. These parameters may change if new data becomes available or if market conditions shift.",
