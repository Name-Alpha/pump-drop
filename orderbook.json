The momentum is classified as STABLE.\n\n**Parameter Calculation**\n\n1. **BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM**\n\t* Buy/Sell Ratio: 1.5 (balanced)\n\t* Momentum: STABLE\n2. **LIMIT ORDER**\n\t* Price Change: -29.8% (medium volatility, 10-50%)\n\t* Strong buying pressure: 181 buys > 119 sells\n3. **TAKE PROFIT**\n\t* Volume: $15,683 (low volume, < $3k)\n4. **STOP LOSS**\n\t* High volatility: not applicable (price change < 50%)\n\n**Trading Parameters**\n\nBased on the analysis, here are the dynamic trading parameters for ORAMAMA:\n\n* **BUY**\n\t+ Limit: -2% (enter near market, medium volatility)\n\t+ TP: +5% (take profit early, low volume)\n\t+ SL: -8% (standard stop loss, low volatility)\n\t+ Time: 4h (strong trend, balanced momentum)\n* Alternatively, if the price action changes and becomes more volatile (> 50%), we can revisit and adjust our parameters.\n\n**Decision**\nBased on the calculated parameters, I recommend:\nBUY | Limit:-2% | TP:+5% | SL:-8% | Time:4h\n\nThe ORAMAMA token shows balanced buy/sell pressure and stable momentum. With medium volatility and low volume, it's a good opportunity to enter near market price.",

However, the recent trades show 4 buys out of the last 5 trades, which suggests accelerating momentum.\n\n**Limit Order (where to enter):**\nGiven the low volatility (price change -9.5% is below 50%), we can consider entering near market prices.\n\n**Take Profit:**\nThe current volume is $2,005, which is considered low (< $3k). Therefore, a more conservative take profit range is suitable.\n\n**Stop Loss:**\nConsidering the recent price drop (-9.5%) and low volatility, a tighter stop loss range is applicable.\n\n**Time Frame:**\nGiven the accelerating momentum and low volume, a shorter time frame might be suitable to capitalize on potential gains before the market stabilizes or corrects.\n\nBased on these factors, here are the dynamic trading parameters:\n\nBUY | Limit: -0% | TP: +5% | SL: -5% | Time: 2h\n\nReasoning:\nThe accelerating momentum and recent buying pressure suggest a strong bias towards buying. Entering near market prices (limit at 0%) and setting a take profit of +5% should allow for some appreciation in the short term. A stop loss of -5% provides a reasonable buffer against potential price drops.\n\nNote: These parameters are specific to Lupe/SOL and may not apply to other tokens or markets. It's essential to continuously monitor market conditions and adjust strategies as needed.",
