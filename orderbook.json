However, we'll use standard parameters to err on the side of caution.\n\n**LIMIT ORDER (WHERE TO ENTER)**:\nGiven the low volume and stable momentum, we can consider entering near market price with a slight discount.\n\n**TAKE PROFIT**:\nWith medium volume ($4k is between $3k-$10k), let's aim for 5-10% profit to take advantage of potential liquidity.\n\n**STOP LOSS**:\nSince the volatility is relatively low, we'll set a tighter stop-loss at -5%.\n\n**TIME FRAME**:\nConsidering the stable momentum and low volume, let's use a slightly longer time frame of 2 hours to give the trade some breathing room.\n\nBased on these parameters:\n\n**DECISION**: WATCH\n\nReason: The token shows balanced buying pressure and stable flow momentum, but with relatively low trading activity.
