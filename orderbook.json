The stable momentum and medium volatility suggest a moderate entry point (-1.8%) and take profit (+12%). The stop loss of -10% provides room to breathe in case the trade goes against us.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe token has shown a relatively balanced market with some buying pressure, but not extremely high risk. The stable momentum indicates that the price is likely to continue trading within its current range rather than experiencing extreme movements. This suggests a cautious approach, which is reflected in the moderate entry point and take profit.",
