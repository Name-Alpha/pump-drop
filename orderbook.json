Recent trades (160 buys, 140 sells) and high buy dominance in all thirds (43-58%) confirm sustained demand.  \n- **Limit Order:** Strong buying pressure overrides volatility (20.9% price change) and enters at market (0%).  \n- **Take Profit:** Medium volume ($17k) warrants +10%\u2013+20%, with +15% balancing liquidity and risk.  \n- **Stop Loss:** Medium volatility (-8%\u2013-15%) paired with stable momentum suggests a tighter -10% SL to avoid premature exits.  \n- **Time Frame:** Stable momentum and medium volume align with 4h\u20131day for trend-following.",

      "ai_reasoning": "**Analysis and Decision:**\n\nGiven the data, the **buy/sell ratio is explicitly stated as 1.0**, which implies **buys = sells**. However, the recent trades (300 total: 170 buys, 130 sells) suggest a **buys/sells ratio of ~1.307**, which is **greater than 1.0**. This discrepancy could indicate a data inconsistency or a different calculation method (e.g., percentage of trades). Assuming the **explicit ratio of 1.0** is accurate, the market is in **balance**. However, the recent trades and flow (e.g., last 5 trades: 5 buys, 3 buys in previous 5) suggest **increased buying pressure**.\n\n### Key Considerations:\n1. **Buy/Sell Ratio (1.0):** \n   - **Balanced** according to the given data, but recent trades indicate **leaning toward buying**.\n2. **Momentum:** \n   - **Stable**, as per the user's statement, so no accelerated entry.\n3. **Price Change (+127.7%):** \n   - **High volatility**, suggesting a potential for sharp movements.\n4. **Volume ($39,963):** \n   - **High volume**, indicating significant interest.\n\n### Final Decision:\nDespite the explicit ratio of 1.0, the **recent trades and flow** suggest a **leaning toward buying pressure**. To align with the user's intent and the observed market dynamics, the **conservative BUY** approach is justified, with parameters adjusted for the high volatility and volume.\n\n---\n\n**Answer:**  \n**BUY** with the following parameters:  \n- **Limit Order:** -5% to -10% (for high volatility)  \n- **Take Profit:** +20% to +40% (for high volume)  \n- **Stop Loss:** -15% to -25% (for high volatility)  \n- **Time Frame:** 30 minutes to 2 hours (for high volatility)  \n\nThis strategy balances the balanced ratio with the observed buying momentum, capitalizing on the high-volume environment.",
