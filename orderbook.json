      "ai_reasoning": "**Analysis and Decision:**\n\n1. **Buy Signal (Ratio > 1.5):**  \n   The price change of **+43.8%** indicates a strong upward trend. The **buy ratio (2.2)** exceeds the threshold of **1.5**, confirming a strong buy signal. This suggests a high probability of further price appreciation.\n\n2. **Limit Order (Strong Buying Pressure):**  \n   Given the **strong buying pressure** (ratio of 2.2), the **limit price** should be set at **0%** (i.e., no stop-loss; the strategy assumes the market is in a strong uptrend and the entry is optimal).\n\n3. **Take Profit (Low Volume):**  \n   The **volume of $7,343** falls into the **medium volume** category (between $3k and $10k). However, the **take profit target** is set at **+8%** to align with the **low volume** range (**+5% to +10%**), reflecting a cautious approach to capitalize on the upward momentum without overextending.\n\n4. **Stop Loss (Medium Volatility):**  \n   The **price change of 43.8%** is classified as **medium volatility** (10%\u201350%). For medium volatility, the **stop-loss range** is **-8% to -15%**. To balance risk and reward, a **-8% stop-loss** is chosen, providing a moderate buffer while maintaining exposure to the upward trend.\n\n5. **Time Frame (Strong Trend):**  \n   The **+43.8% price change** and **strong buying pressure** indicate a **strong trend**. The **time frame** is set to **4 hours to 1 day**, allowing sufficient time to capture the trend while avoiding overexposure to short-term volatility.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \n**BUY**  \n- **Limit Price:** 0%  \n- **Take Profit:** +8%  \n- **Stop Loss:** -8%  \n- **Time Frame:** 4 hours to 1 day  \n\nThis strategy leverages the strong upward momentum, medium volatility, and medium volume to optimize risk-adjusted returns.",

      "ai_reasoning": "**Decision:** WATCH  \n**Reasoning:**  \nThe provided **Buy/Sell ratio of 0.8** (less than 1.0) indicates **more sells than buys**, signaling **high risk** per Rule 1. However, the **recent trades (5 consecutive buys)** and **STABLE flow momentum** suggest some **buying pressure** and **balanced market sentiment**. This creates a **mixed signal**: while the ratio leans toward risk, the recent activity hints at potential recovery. Thus, **WATCH** is the cautious choice to monitor further developments before committing to a trade.\n\n---\n\n**Dynamic Trading Parameters:**  \n1. **Limit Order:**  \n   - **Range:** -2% to -5%  \n   - **Rationale:** Medium volatility (+22.7% price change) warrants a conservative entry point to mitigate downside risk.  \n\n2. **Take Profit:**  \n   - **Range:** +5% to +10%  \n   - **Rationale:** Low volume ($3,834) suggests limited liquidity, so a moderate profit target balances risk and reward.  \n\n3. **Stop Loss:**  \n   - **Range:** -5% to -8%  \n   - **Rationale:** To protect against the high-risk scenario implied by the Buy/Sell ratio.  \n\n4. **Time Frame:**  \n   - **Range:** 2 hours to 6 hours  \n   - **Rationale:** Short-term focus aligns with the STABLE momentum and allows for quick adjustments based on incoming data.  \n\n---\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- **Monitor** the **recent buying trend** and **volume changes** closely.  \n- If the **Buy/Sell ratio improves** (e.g., >1.0) or **volume spikes**, consider transitioning to a **BUY** strategy.  \n- If **sells dominate** or **volume declines**, tighten stop-loss and exit the position.  \n\n**Final Note:** The market is in a **state of flux**, and further clarity on the Buy/Sell ratio and volume dynamics will be critical for decision-making. Stay disciplined and avoid over-leveraging.",
