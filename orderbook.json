      "ai_reasoning": "**Analysis:**\n\nThe provided data includes a **Buy/Sell Ratio of 1.4**, which indicates a **balanced market** (buys are 1.4 times sells). However, the recent trades (116 buys, 184 sells) suggest a **slightly stronger sell pressure** (sells are 1.58 times buys), which may imply a **short-term bearish bias**. Despite this, the **overall ratio of 1.4** is considered balanced, and the **market momentum is stable** (no clear trend).\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n1. **Ratio Interpretation:** The Buy/Sell Ratio of 1.4 suggests that for every 1 sell, there are 1.4 buys. This is a **balanced market** but slightly tilted toward buyers.\n2. **Volume and Price Movement:** The low volume and moderate price change (15.3%) indicate **limited liquidity** and **no strong directional momentum**.\n3. **Recent Trade Imbalance:** While the overall ratio is balanced, the recent trades (116 buys vs. 184 sells) show a **short-term sell pressure**, which could be a **temporary correction**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe market is **balanced** with a slight tilt toward buyers, but the recent trades suggest **short-term bearish pressure**. Given the **stable momentum** and **moderate volume**, a **conservative approach** is appropriate. The **Buy/Sell Ratio of 1.4** does not meet the threshold for a clear **BUY signal**, so the decision is to **WATCH** for further confirmation.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n**WATCH**  \n*Reason:* The Buy/Sell Ratio of 1.4 indicates a balanced market, but recent trades show a slight short-term sell pressure. The stable momentum and moderate volume suggest a conservative approach is prudent. Further confirmation of a trend is needed before taking a directional position.  \n\n**Parameters (if a conservative BUY were considered):**  \n- **Limit:** -2% to -5% (medium volatility)  \n- **Take Profit:** +5% to +10% (low volume)  \n- **Stop Loss:** -8% to -15% (medium volatility)  \n- **Timeframe:** 2h to 6h (low volume)  \n\nHowever, based on the given data and risk management, **WATCH** is the recommended action.",
