      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the provided data, I will analyze the Solana token GNFO and provide dynamic trading parameters.\n\n**1. BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM:**\n\nThe buy/sell ratio is 0.9, indicating more sells than buys. According to the rules:\n\n* If more sells than buys (ratio < 1.0): **SKIP or WATCH (high risk)**\n\nSince the momentum is STABLE, I will lean towards a more cautious approach.\n\n**2. LIMIT ORDER:**\n\nThe price change is -1.5%, which falls into the category of low volatility (< 10%).\n\n* Low volatility (< 10%): 0% to -2% (enter near market)\n\nConsidering the buy/sell ratio and stable momentum, I will err on the side of caution and choose a slightly more conservative entry point.\n\n**Limit:** -1.5%\n\n**3. TAKE PROFIT:**\n\nThe volume is $5,952, which falls into the category of low volume (< $3k).\n\n* Low volume (< $3k): +5% to +10% (take profit early)\n\nGiven the stable momentum and low volatility, a more modest take-profit target seems appropriate.\n\n**TP:** +7%\n\n**4. STOP LOSS:**\n\nThe price change is -1.5%, which falls into the category of low volatility.\n\n* Low volatility: -5% to -8%\n\nConsidering the stable momentum, I will choose a relatively tight stop-loss level.\n\n**SL:** -6%\n\n**5. TIME FRAME:**\n\nGiven the low volume and stable momentum, a slightly longer time frame seems suitable.\n\n**Time:** 4h\n\n**FINAL DECISION:**\n\n**WATCH (with caution)**\n\nReason: While the token shows some buying pressure in the recent trades, the overall buy/sell ratio is unfavorable, indicating high risk. A more cautious approach is warranted to avoid potential losses.",
