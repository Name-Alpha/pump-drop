      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the data provided, I will analyze the token and provide dynamic trading parameters.\n\n**Token Analysis**\n\nThe token is Xingxing/SOL, with a current price of $0.00011449, volume of $13,164, buy/sell ratio of 1.6, and a recent price change of +19.4%. The trade flow indicates stable momentum, with the most recent third (100 trades) having 69 buys (69.0%).\n\n**Trading Parameters**\n\nBased on the data, here are the dynamic trading parameters:\n\n* **BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM**: Strong buying pressure, with a buy/sell ratio of 1.6.\n* **LIMIT ORDER**: Given the recent price change and stable momentum, we can enter near market prices.\n* **TAKE PROFIT**:\n\t+ Volume: Low ($13k), so take profit early: +5% to +10%.\n* **STOP LOSS**:\n\t+ Volatility: Medium (price change of 19.4%), so -8% to -15%.\n* **TIME FRAME**: Given the low volume and medium volatility, a time frame of 2h to 6h is suitable.\n\n**Decision**\n\nBased on these parameters, I recommend:\n\nBUY | Limit:0% | TP:+7% | SL:-10% | Time:3h\n\nThis trade has a moderate risk-reward ratio, with a potential profit of +7% and a stop loss of -10%. The time frame is set to 3 hours, allowing for some room to breathe while still capturing the recent price momentum.\n\n**Reasoning**\n\nThe token shows strong buying pressure, but the volume is relatively low. To mitigate risk, we can enter near market prices and take profit early. A stop loss of -10% provides a reasonable safety net, while a time frame of 3 hours allows for some flexibility in case the trend reverses.\n\n**Note**: This trade should be considered as a speculative opportunity, given the token's low price and relatively high volatility. It is essential to monitor the market conditions closely and adjust the parameters accordingly.",

We'll set the Take Profit range at +5% to +10%.\n\n**Rule 4: STOP LOSS**\n\nPrice Change: +10.3% (medium volatility)\nFlow Momentum: STABLE\n\nConsidering medium volatility and stable momentum, we'll use a standard stop loss range of -8% to -12%.\n\n**Rule 5: TIME FRAME**\n\nLow volume and moderate buying pressure suggest a shorter time frame. We'll set the time frame at **2h**.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nBUY | Limit:-3% | TP:+7% | SL:-10% | Time:2h\n\nThis means we should buy the token with an aggressive entry at -3% below the current price, aim to take profit at +7%, and set a stop loss at -10%.
