      "ai_reasoning": "**Analysis and Decision:**\n\n1. **Buy/Sell Ratio:**  \n   The user specifies a **Buy/Sell Ratio of 1.4**, which falls within the **balanced range (1.0\u20131.5)**. However, the **recent 300 trades** show **182 buys and 118 sells**, implying a **higher ratio of 1.54**, which is **strong buying**. This discrepancy suggests a possible data entry error, but we proceed with the **user-provided ratio of 1.4**.\n\n2. **Price Change:**  \n   A **+20.5% price change** indicates **medium volatility** (since high volatility is >50%, and low is <10%).\n\n3. **Limit Order (Rule 2):**  \n   For **medium volatility**, the limit range is **-2% to -5%**. However, **strong buying pressure** (if the ratio were 1.54) would suggest a **0% limit**. Since the ratio is 1.4 (balanced), the **limit is -2% to -5%**.\n\n4. **Take Profit (Rule 3):**  \n   The **volume of $4,324** is **low**, so the take profit range is **+5% to +10%**.\n\n5. **Stop Loss (Rule 4):**  \n   For **low volume**, the stop loss range is **-5% to -8%**.\n\n6. **Time Frame (Rule 5):**  \n   **Low volume** suggests a **2-hour to 6-hour** time frame.\n\n7. **Flow Momentum:**  \n   The **stable momentum** aligns with **standard parameters**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Decision:**  \nWhile the **actual trade data suggests a stronger buying signal**, the **user-provided ratio of 1.4** (balanced) leads to a **WATCH** recommendation. However, if the ratio is corrected to **1.54**, the decision would shift to **BUY** with **aggressive parameters**.\n\n**Answer:**  \n**WATCH**  \n- **Limit Order:** -2% to -5%  \n- **Take Profit:** +5% to +10%  \n- **Stop Loss:** -5% to -8%  \n- **Time Frame:** 2-hour to 6-hour  \n\n**Note:** If the ratio is actually **1.54**, the decision would be **BUY** with **0% limit**, **+5% to +10% take profit**, **-5% to -8% stop loss**, and **2-hour to 6-hour time frame**.",
