The STABLE flow momentum also suggests that there's no strong indication of either accelerating or decelerating momentum, which would have triggered more conservative or aggressive strategies.\n\n**Token-specific parameters**\n\nFor ZEPTOCLAW / SOL:\n\n* **Volume threshold**: $10k (considered high volume)\n* **Price change**: +39.1% (high volatility)\n* **Buy/Sell Ratio**: 1.3 (slightly biased towards buying)\n\nNote that these parameters will change based on the token's specific data and market conditions.",

This suggests a potential uptrend.\n\t* Flow momentum is STABLE, which aligns with the stable ratio.\n2. **Limit Order (where to enter):**\n\t* Price change is +28.4%, which falls under medium volatility (10-50%). Thus, we can enter near market with a -3% limit order.\n3. **Take Profit:**\n\t* Volume is $6,697, which is relatively low. Considering the recent price increase and stable momentum, a take profit of +15% seems reasonable.\n4. **Stop Loss:**\n\t* Given the medium volatility, a stop loss of -10% provides some room to breathe while limiting potential losses.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n* The token's price has increased significantly (+28.4%) in recent trades, which may indicate a strong trend or a speculative bubble. Monitor the situation closely for potential reversals.\n* With low volume and stable momentum, it's essential to be cautious and set realistic expectations.\n\nThis analysis is based on the provided data and the dynamic trading parameters outlined above. As always, trading involves risk, and it's crucial to monitor market conditions and adjust strategies accordingly.",
