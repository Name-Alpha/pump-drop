However, it's above the medium threshold ($3k-$10k), so we apply parameters for medium-high volume:\n     - Take Profit: +10% to +20%\n\n4. **STOP LOSS**\n   - Applying parameters for high volatility due to the price change of +35.9%:\n     - Stop Loss: -15% to -25%\n\n5. **TIME FRAME**\n   - Given that this is a trade with some volatility but not extremely high, we can choose a time frame that balances quick trading with sufficient observation period:\n     - Time Frame: 2h\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBased on the dynamic parameters applied, considering the stable momentum and adjusting for volatility:\n\nBUY | Limit:-8% | TP:+15% | SL:-20% | Time:2h\n\nThis suggests buying into Xingxing/SOL with a limit order at 92% of the current price ($0.00017354 * 0.92 = $0.00015949), aiming to take profit at +15% and setting a stop loss at -20% from the entry point, for a 2-hour time frame.",

Therefore, we will enter at a -5% limit order.\n3. **TAKE PROFIT**\n\t* The volume is $5,178, which falls into the \"medium\" category ($3k-$10k). Hence, our take profit target will be +15%.\n4. **STOP LOSS**\n\t* Since there's high volatility ( price change > 10%), we'll set a stop loss of -12% to give some room for price fluctuations.\n5. **TIME FRAME**\n\t* Given the low volume and stable momentum, we'll choose a 2h time frame for this trade.\n\n**Decision**\n\nWATCH with brief reason: Balanced buy/sell ratio and stable momentum indicate that the market is currently stable, but not overly bullish or bearish. We'll wait to see how the price develops before making an entry decision.\n\n**Formatted Parameters (if BUY was chosen)**\n\nBUY | Limit:-5% | TP:+15% | SL:-12% | Time:2h",
