BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM:**\n\n* Buy/Sell Ratio: 3.6 (more buys than sells)\n* Recent trades: 4 buys in the last 5 trades\n* Flow momentum: STABLE\n\nSince there's strong buying pressure with a buy/sell ratio of 3.6 and stable flow momentum, we can consider this token for a BUY.\n\n**2. LIMIT ORDER (where to enter):**\n\n* Price change: -27.1% (medium volatility)\n* Strong buying pressure: 0% (market order, don't wait)\n\nGiven the medium volatility and strong buying pressure, we'll use a limit order near the market price. I recommend entering at **-1%** from the current price.\n\n**3. TAKE PROFIT:**\n\n* Volume: $5,126 (low volume)\n* Recent trades: 211 buys in total\n\nConsidering the low volume and the fact that there are more buys than sells, we'll use a conservative take profit range. I recommend setting **+7%** to **+10%** as our target profit.\n\n**4. STOP LOSS:**\n\n* Price change: -27.1% (medium volatility)\n\nGiven the medium volatility, we'll use a stop loss that's not too tight but also not too far from the current price. I recommend setting **-12%** to **-15%** as our stop loss.\n\n**5. TIME FRAME:**\n\n* Price change: -27.1% (medium volatility)\n* Recent trades: 4 buys in the last 5 trades\n\nConsidering the medium volatility and the fact that there's strong buying pressure, we'll use a time frame that allows for some market movement but also provides opportunities to exit. I recommend using a **2h** time frame.\n\nHere is our dynamic trading strategy:\n\nBUY | Limit:-1% | TP:+7%-+10% | SL:-12%/-15% | Time:2h",
