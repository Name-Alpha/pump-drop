The take profit is set at +18%, and the stop loss is -10%. This trade has a 2h time frame, which allows for some flexibility in case the price moves rapidly.\n\n**Reasoning:**\nStrong buying pressure and stable momentum indicate that the token might continue its upward trend. However, it's essential to set realistic expectations and not over-leverage our positions.",
