With a limit order at -10%, we can capture a bigger dip and take profit when the price reaches +17%. The stop loss is set at -6.5% to minimize losses in case the trend reverses.\n\nNote: I did not output \"WATCH\" or \"SKIP\" since the parameters suggest a strong buying opportunity with a clear strategy for entry, take profit, and stop loss.",
