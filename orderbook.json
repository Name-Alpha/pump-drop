      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the data provided for the Epstein/SOL token, I will calculate dynamic trading parameters using the rules specified. Here are my conclusions:\n\n**BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM:**\nGiven that the buy/sell ratio is 0.8 (<1.0), we observe more sells than buys.\n\n* Since there's a slight imbalance towards selling pressure and considering stable momentum, I'll recommend:\n  * WATCH, but with some caution due to recent strong buying activity.\n\n**LIMIT ORDER (where to enter):**\nWith a price change of +8.6%, the volatility is relatively low (<10%). Additionally, the strong buying pressure is evident from the last 5 trades being buys and the recent trades showing 4 out of 5 as buys.\n\n* Limit Order: **0%**, suggesting entering near market with a market order to capitalize on strong buying activity.\n\n**TAKE PROFIT (TP):**\nConsidering the volume ($6,015), which falls under medium-low volume (<$10k).\n\n* Take Profit: **+10%**\n\n**STOP LOSS (SL):**\nGiven the low volatility and stable momentum, we can set a relatively tight stop loss.\n\n* Stop Loss: **-5%**\n\n**TIME FRAME:**\nWith low volatility and strong buying pressure, it's advisable to have a shorter time frame.\n\n* Time Frame: **2h**\n\nDecision:\nWATCH, due to slightly imbalanced sell pressure but strong buying activity in recent trades. Recommend monitoring for potential breakout or consolidation before making an entry decision.\n\nNote that the parameters calculated are specific to the Epstein/SOL token and based on the provided data. These parameters can change as new data becomes available.",
