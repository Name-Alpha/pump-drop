      "ai_reasoning": "**Analysis and Decision:**\n\n1. **Ratio of Buys to Sells (0.4):**  \n   The given ratio of buys to sells is **0.4**, which means **sells are 2.5 times buys**. This indicates **more selling pressure** than buying. According to the rules, a ratio less than 1.0 implies **high risk** due to dominant selling activity.\n\n2. **Price Change (+30.2%):**  \n   While the price has risen significantly, this does not negate the selling pressure indicated by the ratio. The upward movement could be due to **short-term momentum**, but the underlying ratio suggests **potential weakness** in buyer interest.\n\n3. **Flow Momentum (Stable):**  \n   The **stable momentum** implies no clear trend reversal, but the ratio still highlights **imbalance in buying/selling**. Stability does not override the high-risk signal from the ratio.\n\n4. **Volatility Consideration:**  \n   The **+30.2% price change** falls within **medium volatility** (10\u201350%). For medium volatility, the **limit order range is -2% to -5%**. However, the **high-risk signal from the ratio** overrides this, as the ratio is a stronger indicator of market sentiment.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**  \n   Despite the price increase and stable momentum, the **dominant selling pressure** (ratio of 0.4) and **high-risk classification** suggest that the market is **overbought or vulnerable to correction**. The decision should prioritize **risk management** over potential short-term gains.\n\n---\n\n**Final Decision:**  \n**SKIP** the trade. The market is in a high-risk state due to dominant selling pressure, and the upward momentum is not supported by buyer activity. Wait for clearer buying signals or a reversal in the ratio before entering.  \n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- **Limit Order:** If forced to trade, use a **-5% stop-loss** to mitigate risk.  \n- **Monitor:** Track the ratio and volume for signs of improving buyer interest.  \n- **Patience:** Avoid impulsive trades in a high-risk environment.  \n\n**Answer:**  \n**SKIP** the trade due to high selling pressure and risk. Wait for a reversal in the ratio or stronger buying signals.",
