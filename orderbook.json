However, with a strong buying pressure and stable momentum, we can be more aggressive in our entry.\n3. **TAKE PROFIT**\n\t* The volume is moderate ($20,326). We'll aim for a take profit of +15% to +25%.\n4. **STOP LOSS**\n\t* With medium volatility and stable momentum, we'll set a stop loss of -10% to -15%.\n\n**Trading Parameters:**\n\nBUY | Limit:-0% (Market Order) | TP:+20% | SL:-12% | Time:1h\n\nThe reasoning is:\n\n* We're entering a market order since the buy/sell ratio is less than 1.0, indicating high risk.\n* Our take profit target is +20%, which should give us sufficient room to capture potential gains while avoiding over-optimism.\n* The stop loss is set at -12% to minimize potential losses if the trade doesn't work out.\n\n**Risk Note:**\n\nThis trade carries a HIGH RISK due to the more sells than buys ratio and medium volatility. Consider proper risk management techniques, such as position sizing and hedging, before entering this trade.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to adjust or clarify anything!",
