The market order will enter near the current price, with a take profit target of +7% and a stop loss range of -6%. This trade will be held for at least 4 hours.\n\n**Reasoning**\n\nThe token has shown strong buying pressure and stable momentum, indicating a potential trend reversal or continuation. The recent decline in price (-13.4%) may have created a buying opportunity. With low volume and low volatility, we'll use more conservative parameters to manage risk.",
