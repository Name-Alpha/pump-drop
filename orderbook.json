BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM:**\n\n* Current ratio: 2.6 (buy/sell)\n* Recent trades: 3 buys in last 5 trades\n* Trade flow: STABLE momentum\n\nGiven the strong buying pressure and stable momentum, we can consider an aggressive entry.\n\n**2. LIMIT ORDER (where to enter):**\n\n* Volatility: -35.6% price change\n* Volume: $24,688 (medium volume)\n\nConsidering the moderate price volatility and medium volume, a limit order at -2% to -5% from current price seems reasonable.\n\n**3. TAKE PROFIT:**\n\n* Current volume: $24,688 (medium volume)\n* Liquidity: sufficient for exit\n\nGiven the medium volume and relatively stable momentum, a take profit of +10% to +20% is suitable.\n\n**4. STOP LOSS:**\n\n* Volatility: -35.6%\n* Recent trades: 3 buys in last 5 trades (stable momentum)\n\nConsidering the moderate price volatility and stable momentum, a stop loss of -8% to -15% seems reasonable.\n\n**5. TIME FRAME:**\n\n* Momentum: STABLE\n* Volume: $24,688 (medium volume)\n\nGiven the stable momentum and medium volume, a time frame of 2h to 6h is suitable for this trade.\n\nConsidering all these factors, here are the dynamic trading parameters:\n\nBUY | Limit:-2% | TP:+12% | SL:-10% | Time:3h\n\nThis decision is based on the strong buying pressure, stable momentum, and moderate price volatility. The limit order at -2% is set to allow for some price adjustment before entering the market. The take profit of +12% is adjusted to match the current market conditions, and the stop loss of -10% provides a reasonable buffer in case of unexpected price movements.",
