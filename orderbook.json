      "ai_reasoning": "**Analysis of the Scenario:**\n\n1. **Buy/Sell Ratio (0.6):**  \n   The provided ratio of 0.6 suggests that the number of buys is 60% of the number of sells. This implies **more sells than buys**, which aligns with a **bearish or neutral sentiment**. According to the rules, this would typically trigger a **\"SKIP or WATCH (high risk)\"** decision due to the imbalance in buying pressure.\n\n2. **Recent Trade Activity:**  \n   - Last 5 trades: 3 buys (implied 2 sells).  \n   - Previous 5 trades: 3 buys (implied 2 sells).  \n   - This suggests **recent buying activity** in the last 10 trades, which could indicate a **short-term bullish trend**. However, this is inconsistent with the overall ratio of 0.6 (which implies more sells overall). This discrepancy may indicate **data inconsistency** or **misinterpretation**.\n\n3. **Trade Flow Momentum (STABLE):**  \n   The trade flow is described as **stable**, which suggests no clear directional bias in the market. This stability, combined with the **low buy/sell ratio**, reinforces the **\"WATCH\"** decision.\n\n4. **Price Change (+28.3%) and Volume ($15,469):**  \n   - **Price Change:** A 28.3% increase indicates **strong upward momentum**, which could signal a potential reversal or continuation.  \n   - **Volume:** Medium volume ($15,469) suggests **moderate participation**, which is neither bullish nor bearish in isolation but can validate the price movement.\n\n---\n\n**Final Decision and Parameters:**\n\n- **Decision:** **WATCH**  \n  The buy/sell ratio (0.6) indicates more sells than buys, but the recent trades show some buying activity. The stable momentum and medium volume suggest caution, so **watching the market** is appropriate.\n\n- **Limit Order:**  \n  For **medium volatility** (price change of 28.3%), use a **-2% to -5% stop-loss** to protect against potential downturns.\n\n- **Take Profit:**  \n  For **medium volume**, set a **+10% to +20%** take-profit target to capitalize on the upward momentum.\n\n- **Time Frame:**  \n  Monitor the market over a **4-hour to 1-day** period to assess whether the recent buying activity sustains or reverses.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nWhile the overall buy/sell ratio suggests caution, recent trades and price movement indicate potential for a short-term rally. A **WATCH** decision with defined risk and reward parameters is advisable.",
