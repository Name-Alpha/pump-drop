However, the momentum is stable, and the price change is moderate. It's better to wait and observe before making a trade.\n\n**Dynamic Parameters:**\n\n1. **BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM:**\n\t* If more sells than buys (ratio < 1.0): SKIP or WATCH\n\t* If balanced (ratio 1.0-1.5): WATCH or conservative BUY\n\t* If strong buying (ratio > 1.5): BUY with aggressive parameters\n\n2. **LIMIT ORDER (where to enter):**\n\t* Given the moderate price change (-14.2%), I would consider a limit order -3% below the current price.\n\n3. **TAKE PROFIT:**\n\t* Considering the low volume ($65,800), a more conservative take profit target is +5%.\n\n4. **STOP LOSS:**\n\t* With stable momentum and moderate price change, a stop loss of -8% seems reasonable.\n\n5. **TIME FRAME:**\n\t* For this token, I would recommend a 2h to 6h time frame due to the low volume.\n\n**Format:** WATCH\n\nBased on these parameters, if you decide to enter a trade, here's an example:\n\nBUY | Limit:-3% | TP:+5% | SL:-8% | Time:4h",
