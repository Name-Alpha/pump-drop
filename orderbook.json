      "ai_reasoning": "**Analysis and Decision:**\n\n1. **Buy/Sell Ratio:**  \n   The provided Buy/Sell ratio is **0.5**, which is **less than 1.0**. According to Rule 1, this indicates **more sells than buys**, signaling **high risk**. However, the **recent trades (300 total)** and **trade flow data** suggest **more buys** (144 buys vs. 156 sells). This discrepancy may stem from conflicting data, but we proceed with the **given ratio of 0.5**.\n\n2. **Limit Order (Price Change):**  \n   The price has increased by **+1.5%**, indicating **low volatility**. Rule 2 specifies that for low volatility, the limit order range is **0% to -2%** (enter near market). However, the **high-risk ratio** (0.5) might suggest waiting for a dip, but the low volatility overrides this, so **0% to -2%** is appropriate.\n\n3. **Take Profit (Volume):**  \n   The volume is **$3,779**, which is **low** (<$3,000). Rule 3 states take profit is **+5% to +10%**.\n\n4. **Stop Loss (Volatility):**  \n   Low volatility implies a **-5% to -8%** stop loss range.\n\n5. **Time Frame (Volume):**  \n   Low volume suggests a **2-hour to 6-hour** holding period.\n\n---\n\n**Final Decision:**  \nDespite the recent trades suggesting more buys, the **given Buy/Sell ratio of 0.5** indicates **more sells**, which is **high risk**. Therefore, the decision is to **WATCH** the market.  \n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- **Limit Order:** Enter near market (0% to -2%).  \n- **Take Profit:** +5% to +10%.  \n- **Stop Loss:** -5% to -8%.  \n- **Time Frame:** 2 to 6 hours.  \n\n**Action:** Monitor the market closely for any reversal signals or further confirmation of the buy trend. Adjust the strategy based on updated data.  \n\n**Answer:**  \n**WATCH** the market with a limit order of 0% to -2%, take profit at +5% to +10%, stop loss at -5% to -8%, and a time frame of 2 to 6 hours.",
