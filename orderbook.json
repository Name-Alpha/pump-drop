The flow momentum is STABLE, indicating that the buying pressure has been consistent over time.\n\n**Buy/Sell Pressure & Momentum**\n\nGiven the balanced buy/sell ratio of 1.1 and stable momentum, I will apply standard parameters for a WATCH decision:\n\nWATCH: Balanced trading activity with slight buying pressure; wait for further confirmation before entering.\n\n**Limit Order (where to enter)**\n\nThe price change is +132.4%, indicating high volatility. Therefore, I will use the -5% to -10% limit order range for a market entry.\n\n**Take Profit**\n\nWith a moderate volume of $31,601, I will use the medium-volume parameters: +10% to +20%.\n\n**Stop Loss**\n\nConsidering the high volatility and recent price movement, I will set a stop loss at -12% to -18%. This allows room to breathe while minimizing potential losses.\n\n**Time Frame**\n\nGiven the strong trend and low volume, I recommend a 4h to 1day time frame for this trade.\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nBased on the analysis, the decision is:\n\nWATCH | Limit:-8% | TP:+15% | SL:-14% | Time:6h",

The flow momentum is STABLE, which suggests that the trend is stable and not accelerating or decelerating rapidly.\n\n**Limit Order (where to enter):**\nGiven the high volatility with a price change of +59.4%, we'll use a more conservative approach. However, since there's strong buying pressure, we can enter near market price.\n\n* **Limit:** 0% (market order)\n\n**Take Profit:**\nThe volume is $6,019, which falls within the medium volume category ($3k-$10k). We'll set a take profit target of +15%.\n\n* **TP:** +15%\n\n**Stop Loss:**\nGiven the high volatility, we need to be cautious with our stop loss. However, since the momentum is stable and not decelerating rapidly, we can use a relatively tight stop loss.\n\n* **SL:** -8%\n\n**Time Frame:**\nThe volume is relatively low ($6,019), so we'll use a longer time frame to give the trade more room to breathe.\n\n* **Time:** 4h\n\nBased on these parameters, here's the trading decision:\n\n**BUY | Limit:0% | TP:+15% | SL:-8% | Time:4h**\n\nThe brief reason for choosing a buy is that there's strong buying pressure with a stable momentum, and we can enter near market price. The risk-reward ratio seems reasonable given the parameters set above.\n\nNote that these parameters are dynamic and may change based on future trades or changes in the token's price action.",
