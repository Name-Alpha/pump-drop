The limit order is set at 0% to enter near market, with a take profit of +12% to +20%, considering the medium volume. A stop loss of -18% to -25% will allow for some room to breathe in case of high volatility.\n\n**Token 2: SOL (standard analysis for comparison)**\n\n* Current Price: $50\n* Volume: $1,000,000\n* Buy/Sell Ratio: 0.8 (more sells than buys)\n* Price Change: +10% (medium volatility)\n\nAnalysis:\n\nBased on the rules:\n\n1. **BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM**: More sells than buys with a ratio of 0.8.\n2. **LIMIT ORDER**: With medium volatility, enter at -3% to -5%.\n3. **TAKE PROFIT**: High volume ($1M), so take profit between +20% to +40%.\n4. **STOP LOSS**: Medium volatility, so set a stop loss between -10% to -15%.\n\n**Decision**\n\nWATCH with reason: More sells than buys and decelerating momentum.\n\nIn this case, I would recommend watching the token, as there's more selling pressure and decelerating momentum, indicating a possible dip. A more conservative approach is recommended, rather than taking an aggressive position.",
