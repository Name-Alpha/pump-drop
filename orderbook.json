      "ai_reasoning": "**Analysis Summary:**\n\n1. **Buy/Sell Ratio (0.9):**  \n   - According to the provided ratio (0.9), this falls below 1.0, which the rules indicate implies **more sells than buys**. This would typically suggest a **WATCH** or **SKIP** decision. However, the recent trade data (4 buys in last 5 trades, 2 buys in previous 5) and the trade flow (56% buys in recent third) strongly indicate **strong buying pressure**. This discrepancy highlights potential ambiguity in the ratio's interpretation.\n\n2. **Price Change (+11.4%):**  \n   - A positive price movement suggests **bullish momentum**, which aligns with the recent trades and flow data.\n\n3. **Volume ($36,916):**  \n   - Medium volume ($3k\u2013$10k range), which supports a **take profit range of +10% to +20%** and a **stop loss range of -8% to -15%**.\n\n4. **Trade Flow and Momentum (STABLE):**  \n   - The trade flow (56% buys in recent third) and stable momentum suggest **continuation of buying pressure**, which could justify a **BUY** if the ratio is interpreted differently.\n\n---\n\n**Final Decision:**  \nGiven the **conflicting signals** (ratio <1.0 vs. recent trade data), the safest interpretation under the user's rules is to **WATCH**. However, the strong recent buying momentum and stable flow suggest the ratio might be misinterpreted. If the ratio were actually **buys/sells > 1.5**, the decision would be **BUY** with aggressive parameters. \n\n**Recommendation:**  \n**WATCH** due to the provided ratio (0.9 <1.0) and the rules, but **monitor closely** for further confirmation of the ratio's accuracy.  \n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n**WATCH**  \n*Reason: The provided buy/sell ratio (0.9) indicates more sells than buys, but recent trades and flow momentum suggest strong buying pressure. Further confirmation of the ratio's accuracy is recommended.*",

However, to account for volatility, a conservative -5% is applied.  \n- **TAKE PROFIT:** Low volume (<$3k) \u2192 +5% to +10%. Higher TP (+10%) to exploit potential liquidity from the recent buying surge.  \n- **STOP LOSS:** Low volatility (volume < $3k) \u2192 -5% to -8%. Tighter SL (-8%) to mitigate risk from low liquidity.  \n- **TIME FRAME:** High volatility (100% price change) \u2192 30min to 2h. 2h balances quick exits with stability.  \n\n**Decision:** BUY with dynamic parameters to capitalize on strong buying momentum while managing risk.",
