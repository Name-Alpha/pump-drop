The limit order is set to 0%, which means buying near the current market price. The take profit target is +7%, and the stop loss is -10%. The time frame is set to 6 hours, allowing for some more conservative trading.\n\nNote: As the flow momentum is stable, it's essential to be cautious not to overtrade or get caught in a potential dip.
