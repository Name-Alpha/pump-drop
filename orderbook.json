There's no indication of accelerating or decelerating momentum.\n\n**Limit Order**\n\nBased on the price change (+19.2%), which falls under medium volatility (10-50%), we will use a limit order entry point at -2% to -5%.\n\n**Take Profit**\n\nWith a low volume ($1,990), we'll use more conservative take profit parameters: +5% to +10%.\n\n**Stop Loss**\n\nConsidering the medium volatility price change and stable momentum, we'll set a stop loss at -8% to -15%.\n\n**Time Frame**\n\nGiven the low volume and stable momentum, we'll choose a 2h time frame.\n\n**Decision**\n\nBased on these parameters, I recommend:\n\nBUY | Limit:-3% | TP:+7% | SL:-12% | Time:2h\n\nThis trade plan takes into account the current market conditions and sets a relatively conservative entry point, with a limited stop loss to minimize potential losses.
