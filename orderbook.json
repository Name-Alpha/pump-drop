      "ai_reasoning": "To determine the appropriate action and parameters for this trading scenario, we must analyze the provided data through the lens of the rules and guidelines given. Here's a structured breakdown of the analysis and final decision:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Buy/Sell Ratio: 1.5**\n- **Rule Interpretation**:  \n  According to the provided rules, a ratio of **1.0 to 1.5** is classified as **balanced**.  \n  - **Action**: This falls into the **\"balanced\"** category, which implies either **WATCH** or **conservative BUY**.  \n  - **Interpretation**: While the ratio is at the upper limit of the balanced range, it does not meet the threshold for **strong buying pressure** (which requires a ratio **> 1.5**).  \n  - **Conclusion**: The action is **conservative BUY**, as the market is not showing overwhelming buying pressure, but there is still a slight bias toward buyers.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Price Change: +11.0%**\n- **Volatility Classification**:  \n  A **11% price change** falls within the **medium volatility** range (10% to 50%).  \n  - **Rule Application**: For **medium volatility**, the **limit order** should be placed **between -2% and -5%** below the current price.  \n  - **Reasoning**: This range allows for a reasonable buffer while still capturing potential pullbacks in a trending market.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Volume: $7,771**\n- **Volume Classification**:  \n  A volume of **$7,771** is considered **low** (less than $3,000).  \n  - **Rule Application**:  \n    - **Take Profit**: For **low volume**, the take profit range is **+5% to +10%**.  \n    - **Stop Loss**: For **low volume**, the stop loss range is **-5% to -8%**.  \n  - **Reasoning**: Low volume suggests a lack of strong conviction in the price movement, so tighter stop-loss and take-profit ranges are appropriate to protect capital and manage risk.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Recent Trades and Flow Momentum**\n- **Recent Trades**:  \n  The last 5 trades show **4 buys**, and the previous 5 trades show **3 buys**.  \n- **Flow Momentum**:  \n  The market shows **stable buying momentum**, but it is **not overwhelming**.  \n- **Conclusion**: While this suggests a **positive trend**, it does not justify a **strong buy**. Instead, it supports a **conservative buy** with caution.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision and Parameters**\n\n- **Action**: **Conservative BUY**  \n- **Limit Order**: **-2% to -5%** (medium volatility range)  \n- **Take Profit**: **+5% to +10%** (low volume range)  \n- **Stop Loss**: **-5% to -8%** (low volume range)  \n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\nGiven the **balanced buy/sell ratio**, **medium volatility**, and **low volume**, the optimal strategy is to **conservatively enter a long position** with **targeted risk/reward parameters**. This approach balances the potential for profit while managing exposure to market uncertainty.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n> **Conservative BUY** with a **limit order between -2% and -5%**, a **take profit between +5% and +10%**, and a **stop loss between -5% and -8%**.",
