      "ai_reasoning": "**Analysis and Decision:**\n\n1. **Buy/Sell Ratio (1.0):**  \n   - The ratio is **balanced** (1.0), which falls under the \"WATCH\" category per Rule 1. However, recent trades (3 buys in 5) and trade flow (59% buys in each third) suggest **strong buying pressure**. This may indicate a **higher effective ratio** than reported, but we proceed with the given data.\n\n2. **Limit Order (Medium Volatility):**  \n   - Price change is **+23.6%** (medium volatility). Rule 2 specifies **-2% to -5%** as the stop-loss range. For a conservative BUY, **-2% to -5%** is appropriate.\n\n3. **Take Profit (Medium Volume):**  \n   - Volume is **$20,610** (medium). Rule 3 recommends **+10% to +20%** for take profit.\n\n4. **Stop Loss (Medium Volatility):**  \n   - Rule 4 assigns **-8% to -15%** for medium volatility. This aligns with the conservative approach.\n\n5. **Time Frame (Stable Momentum):**  \n   - Rule 5 states **2h to 6h** for medium volume and stable momentum. This range balances risk and opportunity.\n\n---\n\n**Final Decision:**  \n**WATCH** with the following parameters:  \n- **Limit:** -2% to -5%  \n- **Take Profit:** +10% to +20%  \n- **Stop Loss:** -8% to -15%  \n- **Time Frame:** 2h to 6h  \n\n**Note:** If the actual ratio exceeds 1.5 (strong buying), the decision would shift to **BUY** with aggressive parameters. However, based on the provided data, **WATCH** is the conservative and rule-compliant choice.",
