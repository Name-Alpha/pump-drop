I will consider medium volatility.\n\t* Since the buy/sell ratio is 1.6, it's a good idea to wait for a dip. Let's set a limit order at -2% to -3%.\n3. **TAKE PROFIT**\n\t* The volume is $83,466, which is considered medium volume ($3k-$10k).\n\t* I will set the take profit at +15% to +20%.\n4. **STOP LOSS**\n\t* With a stable momentum and strong buying pressure, we can set a stop loss slightly tighter than standard.\n\t* Let's set a stop loss at -8% to -10%.\n5. **TIME FRAME**\n\t* Considering the medium volume and stable momentum, I will set the time frame at 2h.\n\n**Decision**\n\nBased on these dynamic trading parameters, I recommend:\n\n**BUY | Limit:-2.5% | TP:+17.5% | SL:-9% | Time:2h**\n\nThis means entering a buy order when the price reaches -2.5% of the current price, aiming to take profit at +17.5%, and setting a stop loss at -9%.",
