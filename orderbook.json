The buy/sell ratio is 1.0, indicating balanced buying and selling pressure. The recent trades show a strong trend in favor of buys, with 4 buys out of the last 5 trades.\n\n**Parameter Analysis**\n\n1. **BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM:**\n\t* Balanced buying and selling pressure (ratio = 1.0).\n\t* Stable momentum.\n2. **LIMIT ORDER (where to enter):**\n\t* Low volatility (< 10%), so we will enter near the market.\n3. **TAKE PROFIT:**\n\t* Medium volume ($3k-$10k), so we will aim for a +15% profit.\n4. **STOP LOSS:**\n\t* Low volatility, so we can set a tighter stop loss of -5%.\n5. **TIME FRAME:**\n\t* Strong trend, so we will use a 4h time frame.\n\n**Dynamic Trading Parameters**\n\nBased on these parameters, here is the output:\n\nBUY | Limit:0% | TP:+15% | SL:-5% | Time:4h\n\nThe reasoning behind this decision is that there is strong buying pressure, balanced momentum, and low volatility. We will enter near the market, aim for a 15% profit, and set a stop loss at -5%. This setup allows us to ride the trend while minimizing potential losses.\n\nNote: The use of 0% limit order means we are entering at the current price without waiting for a dip, which is suitable given the low volatility and strong buying pressure.",

      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the data provided, here's a dynamic analysis of the Solana token Renta (RENTA/SOL):\n\n**Volatility**: High volatility (> 50%) due to recent price change (+30.6%)\n\n**Buy/Sell Ratio**: Balanced (1.5)\n\n**Flow Momentum**: STABLE\n\n**Trade Flow**:\n\n* Early third: 55 buys (55.0%)\n* Middle third: 57 buys (57.0%)\n* Recent third: 55 buys (55.0%)\n\nGiven these parameters, here's the dynamic analysis:\n\n**Decision:** WATCH\n\n**Reasoning**: While the buy/sell ratio is balanced and indicates a neutral market sentiment, the high volatility (> 50%) suggests that the price might continue to fluctuate. With stable momentum and no clear signs of accelerating or decelerating flow, it's best to wait and observe the market dynamics before entering a trade.\n\n**Limit Order**: Given the high volatility, a more conservative entry point is recommended: -5% to -10%. This allows for a potential larger dip in price before entering the trade.\n\n**Take Profit**: Medium volume ($3k-$10k) suggests a moderate take profit of +10% to +20%.\n\n**Stop Loss**: High volatility requires a wider stop loss, so set it at -15% to -25%.\n\n**Time Frame**: With high volatility and no clear trend, a shorter time frame is suitable. Set the trade for 2h.\n\nHere's the final analysis:\n\nWATCH | Limit:-7.5% | TP:+12% | SL:-20% | Time:2h",
