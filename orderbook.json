Considering this, I will use the \"Low volatility (< 10%)\" criteria.\n\t* The token has a price change of -21.3%, indicating medium volatility. However, considering the low volume and balanced buy/sell ratio, I will adjust the entry point to -1.5%.\n3. **TAKE PROFIT**\n\t* Volume is $12,212, which falls into the \"Low volume (< $3k)\" category.\n\t* Take profit should be adjusted for low volume, so I will use +5% to +10%.\n4. **STOP LOSS**\n\t* The token has a price change of -21.3%, indicating medium volatility. I will adjust the stop loss accordingly: -8% to -12%.\n5. **TIME FRAME**\n\t* Considering the balanced buy/sell ratio and stable flow momentum, I will use the standard time frame of 2h.\n\n**Decision**\n\nBased on the analysis, I recommend:\n\nBUY | Limit:-1.5% | TP:+7.5% | SL:-9% | Time:2h\n\nThe BUY signal is based on the balanced buy/sell ratio and stable flow momentum, indicating a relatively neutral market situation. The entry point of -1.5% allows for some buffer in case the price continues to drop. Take profit at +7.5%, and set a stop loss at -9%.",
