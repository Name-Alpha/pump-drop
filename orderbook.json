The recent trades show three buys in the last five trades, which suggests accelerating momentum. Given these indicators, we can conclude that there's strong buying pressure with accelerating momentum.\n\n**Limit Order (where to enter):**\nConsidering the price change of +40% and strong buying pressure, we should enter near market levels. Therefore, the limit order will be 0%.\n\n**Take Profit:**\nThe volume is $60,707, which falls into the \"high volume\" category. We can set the take profit range at +20% to +30%, considering the increased liquidity.\n\n**Stop Loss:**\nGiven the high volatility (price change of +40%) and strong buying pressure, we should set a stop loss that allows for some room to breathe. A stop loss range of -10% to -15% seems reasonable.\n\n**Time Frame:**\nConsidering the strong trend and high volume, I recommend a time frame of 4h to 1day.\n\n**Dynamic Parameters:**\n\n* BUY | Limit:0% | TP:+25% | SL:-12% | Time:6h\n\nThese parameters are based on the specific data provided for the TAPIR/SOL token.",
