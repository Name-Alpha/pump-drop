      "ai_reasoning": "### Analysis of the Market Situation\n\nTo determine the appropriate market action, we analyze the key metrics and how they align with the rules provided:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Buy/Sell Ratio: 0.2**\n\n- This indicates that for every 1 sell, there are 0.2 buys.\n- This ratio is **less than 1.0**, which falls under the category of **\"more sells than buys\"**.\n- According to the rules, this means the market is **biased toward selling**, and the appropriate action is to **skip or watch** the market for now.\n\n> **Note:** While the recent trades show 90 buys and 210 sells (which gives a ratio of ~0.428), the given ratio of 0.2 is used for the decision. This discrepancy might suggest an inconsistency in the data, but we proceed with the provided value.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Price Change: +19.4%**\n\n- This represents a **significant upward movement**, indicating **medium to high volatility**.\n- Based on the rules:\n  - **High volatility (greater than 50%)**: Limit order range: **-5% to -10%**\n  - **Medium volatility (10% to 50%)**: Limit order range: **-2% to -5%**\n- Since 19.4% falls within the **medium volatility** range, the **limit order** should be placed between **-2% to -5%**.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Volume: $3,920**\n\n- This is considered **low volume**, which suggests **limited market participation**.\n- For **take profit**, the rule states:\n  - **Low volume**: Take profit range: **+5% to +10%**\n- So, the **take profit** should be set between **+5% to +10%**.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Stop Loss:**\n\n- Based on volatility, we use the **medium volatility** range:\n  - **Stop loss range**: **-8% to -15%**\n\n---\n\n### **5. Time Frame:**\n\n- Since the price change is **medium volatility**, the **time frame** should be:\n  - **4 hours to 1 day**\n\n---\n\n### **6. Trade Flow Momentum: Stable**\n\n- The trade flow is **stable**, which implies **no strong directional bias** in the market.\n- This supports the **watch** or **skip** decision from Rule 1.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision**\n\n- Despite the recent trades showing a **higher number of buys**, the **given buy/sell ratio of 0.2** indicates **more selling**.\n- Therefore, the appropriate action is to **watch** the market, as the **buy/sell ratio is less than 1.0**, and the market is **not currently showing strong buying pressure**.\n- **Limit order**: -2% to -5%\n- **Take profit**: +5% to +10%\n- **Stop loss**: -8% to -15%\n- **Time frame**: 4 hours to 1 day\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Conclusion**\n\n**Watch the market** due to the **buy/sell ratio of 0.2**, which indicates more sells than buys. Place a **limit order between -2% to -5%**, set a **take profit between +5% to +10%**, and use a **stop loss between -8% to -15%**. Monitor the market for **4 hours to 1 day**.\n\n> **Final Answer:**  \n**Watch the market**.",

The price change of +11.9% and recent 5 consecutive buys signal a bullish momentum shift.  \n- **Volatility:** Price change of +11.9% falls into **medium volatility**, so **-2% to -5%** for limit orders.  \n- **Volume:** Low volume ($4,873) implies **+5% to +10%** take profit (early exit).  \n- **Stop Loss:** Low volatility (-5% to -8%) to protect against sudden dips.  \n- **Time Frame:** Medium volatility and stable momentum suggest **3-hour holding period** for quick profit-taking.  \n\n**Key Dynamic Adjustments:**  \n- **Limit Order:** -2% (medium volatility, avoid over-leveraging).  \n- **Take Profit:** +8% (balanced between low volume and medium volatility).  \n- **Stop Loss:** -5% (low volatility, tighter than high-volatility thresholds).  \n- **Time Frame:** 3h (short-term to capitalize on stable momentum).  \n\n**Decision:** BUY with conservative parameters to align with recent bullish flow and price momentum.",
