The time frame is set to 3 hours.\n\n**Reasoning**\n\nThe token shows balanced buying pressure, stable momentum, and low volatility. Given these conditions, it's a good opportunity to enter the market near current prices with a relatively modest profit target and a standard stop loss. The short time frame of 3 hours allows for quick adjustments based on market developments.",
