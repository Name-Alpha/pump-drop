The **lower end of the range (+20%)** is used as a conservative target.\n\n4. **Stop Loss: -8% to -15%**  \n   - Given the **medium volatility**, the **lower end of the stop loss range (-8%)** is used to limit downside risk while allowing for some flexibility in price movement.\n\n5. **Time Frame: 2h to 6h**  \n   - While the price change is **not high volatility**, the **volume is high**, and the **time frame for medium volatility** is not explicitly defined. The **range from 2h to 6h** is used as a practical, intermediate time frame that aligns with the market's liquidity and activity.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThis strategy balances risk and reward by leveraging the high volume and recent bullish momentum, while setting appropriate limits and stop-loss levels to protect capital.",
