      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the provided data and applying dynamic trading parameters, I will analyze Durag token:\n\n1. **Buy/Sell Pressure & Momentum**:\n   - Ratio: 1.4 (more buys than sells), which falls under strong buying pressure.\n   - Flow momentum is STABLE.\n\n2. **Limit Order**: Since there's a stable momentum and considering the low volume, it might be best to enter near the market price without waiting for a dip due to the lack of significant volatility or changes in demand that would necessitate a wait period.\n\n3. **Take Profit (TP)**:\n   - Volume: $6k is below $10k, so we follow the medium volume parameters.\n   - TP range: +10% to +20%.\n\n4. **Stop Loss (SL)**:\n   - Volatility is low with only a 0.2% price change, indicating stable conditions. Low volatility calls for tighter SL settings.\n   - SL range: -5% to -8%.\n\n5. **Time Frame**: The recent trades and the stable momentum indicate a trend might be stabilizing but not accelerating strongly enough to necessitate an extremely short time frame like 30min. However, given the low volume and stable conditions, sticking to standard parameters for time frames is appropriate.\n\nGiven these considerations:\n\n- **Decision:** BUY\n- **Reasoning:**\n  - The stable momentum indicates a potential trend continuation.\n  - Strong buying pressure suggests there's interest in holding or accumulating Durag tokens.\n  - Low volatility doesn't necessitate aggressive entry timing but does call for being cautious, which is achieved through the chosen parameters.\n\n**BUY Parameters:** \nBUY | Limit:-0% | TP:+15% | SL:-6% | Time:2h\n\nThis recommendation balances the potential for profit with caution against excessive risk due to low volume.",
