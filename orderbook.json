Given the recent price change, let's set it at -12% as a buffer.\n\n**Time Frame:**\n\n* Low volume and stable momentum, so we can use a 2h time frame.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nBUY | Limit:0% | TP:+7.5% | SL:-12% | Time:2h\n\nThis trade suggests buying LARP/SOL at $0.00017334 (0% below the current price), aiming to sell at +7.5% of the entry price ($0.00019529) within 2 hours, and setting a stop loss at -12% ($0.00016103).",

Set stop loss at -12% to -18%.\n5. **TIME FRAME**\n\t* Strong trend with stable momentum suggests a longer time frame. Set the time frame at 2h to 6h.\n\n**Decision**\n\nBUY | Limit:0% | TP:+15% | SL:-14% | Time:4h\n\nThe decision is based on strong buying pressure, high volatility, and stable momentum. The entry limit is set to 0%, as we are entering near the market. Take profit is set at +15% to +20%, and stop loss is set at -12% to -18%. The time frame is set at 4h to allow for a potential trend continuation.\n\n**Note**\n\nThe buy/sell ratio of 1.8 indicates strong buying pressure, but it's essential to monitor the token's behavior closely, as high volatility can lead to rapid price changes.",
