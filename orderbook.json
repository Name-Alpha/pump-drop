Here's the analysis:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n\n* Current Price: $0.00003606\n* Volume: $7,004\n* Buy/Sell Ratio: 1.5 ( Balanced )\n* Price Change: -14.8% ( Medium volatility )\n* Recent trades: 186 buys, 114 sells\n\n**Trade Flow Analysis:**\n\n* The trade flow shows a stable momentum, with the percentage of buys and sells relatively consistent across different time frames.\n* Early third: 64 buys (64.0%)\n* Middle third: 62 buys (62.0%)\n* Recent third: 64 buys (64.0%)\n\n**Dynamic Trading Parameters:**\n\n1. **BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM:**\n\t* Balanced buy/sell ratio of 1.5 indicates a stable market, with moderate buying pressure.\n\t* Stable momentum suggests that the trade is not strongly accelerating or decelerating, which justifies standard parameters.\n2. **LIMIT ORDER (where to enter):**\n\t* Medium volatility price change (-14.8%) suggests entering at -3% to -5%.\n3. **TAKE PROFIT:**\n\t* Low volume ($7,004) indicates that take profit should be set relatively low, around +5% to +10%.\n4. **STOP LOSS:**\n\t* Medium volatility price change suggests setting a stop loss between -8% and -15%.\n\n**Trade Recommendation:**\n\nBased on the analysis, I recommend:\n\nBUY | Limit:-3% | TP:+7% | SL:-12% | Time:2h\n\nThis trade takes into account the balanced buy/sell ratio, stable momentum, medium volatility price change, low volume, and moderate buying pressure.\n\nNote that this is a relatively conservative trade setup, given the market's current conditions.

The trade flow analysis shows a stable momentum, which suggests that the price movement is consistent but not accelerating or decelerating rapidly.\n\n**Limit Order (where to enter):**\nGiven the low volume ($13,253) and recent price change (-53.3%), I would consider this token as having low volatility (< 10%). With strong buying pressure, it's essential to enter near market levels without waiting for a bigger dip. Therefore, I recommend:\n\n**Limit:** 0% (market order)\n\n**Take Profit:**\nConsidering the low volume and recent price change, I would aim for a moderate take-profit range.\n\n**Take Profit:** +5% to +10%\n\n**Stop Loss:**\nGiven the low volatility and stable momentum, I would set a relatively tight stop-loss range.\n\n**Stop Loss:** -5% to -8%\n\n**Time Frame:**\nWith strong buying pressure and low volume, I recommend a shorter time frame to capture potential gains while minimizing losses.\n\n**Time Frame:** 2h\n\nBased on these dynamic parameters, the decision is:\n\n**BUY | Limit:0% | TP:+7.5% | SL:-6.75% | Time:2h**\n\nThis trade has a relatively high risk-reward ratio due to the strong buying pressure and recent price change.
