The limit order is set at -7.5%, which allows for a bigger dip to enter the market with reduced risk. The take profit target is +12%, aiming for a moderate gain given the medium volume. The stop loss is set at -11.25%, providing some room to breathe in case of an unexpected downturn.\n\n**Reasoning:** Given the high volatility and balanced buy/sell ratio, I'm taking a cautious approach with a standard entry point, moderate take profit target, and a relatively tight stop loss.

The limit order will be executed at market price, with a take profit target of +12%, and a stop loss set at -6%. The time frame is 2 hours.\n\n**Reasoning:**\nGiven the token's current conditions, it appears to be in a relatively stable state, with no extreme buy/sell pressure or volatility. While there are more buys than sells, the momentum is stable, indicating that investors are comfortable holding onto their positions. With a medium volume and low volatility, this trade plan aims to capture some upside while limiting potential losses.\n\n**Note:**\nThis analysis is based on the provided data and should not be considered as investment advice.
