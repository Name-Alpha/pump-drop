LIMIT ORDER (where to enter):**\n\nGiven the low volume of $9,135 and a price change of -6.4%, I will apply parameters for Low volatility (< 10%).\n\n* Since there's no strong buying pressure, we'll use the standard limit order range.\n* Limit: -1% to -2%\n\n**3. TAKE PROFIT:**\n\nGiven the low volume of $9,135, I will apply parameters for Low volume (< $3k).\n\n* Take Profit: +5% to +10%\n\n**4. STOP LOSS:**\n\nGiven the price change of -6.4%, which is within medium volatility (10-50%), I will apply parameters for Medium volatility.\n\n* Stop Loss: -8% to -15%\n\n**5. TIME FRAME:**\n\nGiven the low volume, I will apply a standard time frame for Low volume trades.\n\n* Time Frame: 2h\n\n**DECISION:**\n\nBased on these dynamic trading parameters:\n\nBUY | Limit:-1% | TP:+7% | SL:-12% | Time:2h",

Therefore, a moderate limit order is suitable.\n\n**Take Profit:**\nVolume: $3,844 (< $10k) - Low volume\n\nConsidering the low volume and stable momentum, take profit early with a reasonable target.\n\n**Stop Loss:**\nHigh volatility (price change > 50% not present, but recent trades indicate potential volatility) - Assigning medium volatility parameters for now.\n\n**Time Frame:**\nGiven the moderate price movement and no strong trend indication, use a time frame suitable for observing market behavior.\n\n**Decision:**\nBased on these analyses, I recommend:\n\nBUY | Limit:-2% | TP:+8% | SL:-12% | Time:4h\n\nThis decision is based on the conservative approach due to the high risk of more sells than buys and stable momentum. The limit order is set at -2% to avoid entering during a potential dip, while taking profit early with a +8% target. A stop loss of -12% provides room for price correction without significant losses.\n\n**Note:** Be cautious, as this token has exhibited high volatility in the past, and more recent trades may not be indicative of future behavior.",
