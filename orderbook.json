BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM:**\nThe buy/sell ratio is 2.9, which indicates strong buying pressure. With 231 buys out of 300 recent trades, the momentum is ACCELERATING.\n\n* Recommendation: Aggressive entry with a LIMIT ORDER at market price (0%) and TAKE PROFIT at +15% to +20%.\n\n**2. LIMIT ORDER:**\nThe token has low volatility (< 10%), and strong buying pressure indicates that we can enter near the market.\n\n* Recommendation: LIMIT ORDER at 0% (market order).\n\n**3. TAKE PROFIT:**\nThe volume is $57,309, which falls into the Medium volume category ($3k-$10k). With strong buying pressure, we can aim for a higher take profit level.\n\n* Recommendation: TAKE PROFIT at +15% to +20%.\n\n**4. STOP LOSS:**\nWith low volatility and strong buying pressure, we need to set a relatively tight stop loss.\n\n* Recommendation: STOP LOSS at -5% to -8%.\n\n**5. TIME FRAME:**\nConsidering the strong trend and ACCELERATING momentum, we can use a longer time frame to ride the trend.\n\n* Recommendation: Time Frame: 4h\n\nBased on these analyses, here is the decision:\n\nBUY | Limit:0% | TP:+17.5% | SL:-6.75% | Time:4h",

Considering the low volume ($55,974) compared to other parameters, I will adjust this accordingly.\n\n3. **TAKE PROFIT:**\nThe volume is relatively low (< $10k), so we should aim for a more conservative take profit. However, considering the high price change and slightly above balanced buy/sell ratio, I will increase the TP margin.\n\n4. **STOP LOSS:**\nGiven the high volatility (price change > 50%), we need to adjust our stop loss accordingly.\n\n5. **TIME FRAME:**\nConsidering the stable flow momentum, we can use a standard time frame for trading this token.\n\n**Decisions and Parameters:**\n\n* BUY | Limit:-5% | TP:+10% | SL:-12% | Time:2h\nThe price change is high, but the buy/sell ratio is slightly above balanced. We will wait for a 5% dip before entering and aim to take profit at +10%. The stop loss is set at -12%.\n\n**Reasoning:**\nWhile there's no strong buying pressure, the stable flow momentum suggests that this token might be experiencing a trend reversal or a consolidation phase. Given the high price change, it's essential to wait for a bigger dip and adjust our parameters accordingly.\n\nPlease note that these are dynamic parameters based on the provided data and should not be used as generic values for all tokens.
