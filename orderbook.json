      "ai_reasoning": "**Analysis and Decision:**\n\n1. **Buy/Sell Ratio:**  \n   The given ratio is **0.1**, which is **less than 1.0**. According to the rules, this indicates **high risk** (since the ratio < 1.0 suggests more sells than buys). However, the **recent trade flow** (67% buys in the last 100 trades) and **last 5 trades** (0 buys) suggest a **mixed signal**\u2014some recent buying pressure but recent sell activity. This ambiguity makes the ratio interpretation critical.\n\n2. **Price Change and Volatility:**  \n   The price has increased by **+1.1%**, indicating **low volatility**. For low volatility, the **limit order** should be **0% (market order)**, as per the rules.\n\n3. **Take Profit and Stop Loss:**  \n   - **Take Profit:** For low volume ($1,948 < $3,000), the range is **+5% to +10%**.  \n   - **Stop Loss:** For low volatility, the range is **-5% to -8%**.\n\n4. **Time Frame:**  \n   Low volume suggests a **shorter time frame** of **2\u20136 hours**.\n\n5. **Momentum:**  \n   The momentum is **STABLE**, so standard parameters apply.\n\n6. **Final Decision:**  \n   Despite the ambiguous ratio (0.1), the **recent trade flow** and **price increase** suggest **some buying pressure**. However, the **Buy/Sell ratio < 1.0** (0.1) leans toward **high risk**, which would typically justify **SKIP**. However, the **recent buying activity** and **price rise** might warrant a **conservative WATCH**. Given the conflicting data, the safest conclusion is to **WATCH** with caution, using the **low-volatility parameters**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n**WATCH**  \n- **Limit Order:** 0% (Market)  \n- **Take Profit:** +5% to +10%  \n- **Stop Loss:** -5% to -8%  \n- **Time Frame:** 2\u20136 hours  \n\n**Rationale:** While the Buy/Sell ratio (0.1) suggests high risk, recent trade flow and price movement indicate potential buying pressure. A cautious WATCH is appropriate to monitor further developments.",
