Thus, we use a limit order entry of -3% to -5%.\n3. **Take Profit:**\n\t* Volume: $3,776\n\t* This volume falls within the \"Low volume (< $3k)\" category, suggesting conservative take profit parameters.\n4. **Stop Loss:**\n\t* Price Change: -5.6%\n\t* Considering this is a negative price change and relatively low volatility, we lean towards more protective SL for potential losses.\n5. **Time Frame:**\n\t* Low volume and stable momentum suggest a medium to long-term perspective.\n\n**Trading Parameters:**\n\n- BUY | Limit:-3% | TP:+7% | SL:-8% | Time:4h\n\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n- The balanced buy/sell ratio and stable flow momentum justify entering the market.\n- Entering at -3% limit order provides a conservative entry point, considering the recent price drop.\n- With low volume, taking profit early at +7% helps avoid potential losses from future price drops.\n- Setting the stop loss at -8% gives room for minor corrections while still being protective.\n\n**Conclusion:** \n\nGiven these parameters and the data provided, the recommended action is to **BUY** MoltPad/SOL with a limit order entry of -3%, aiming for a take profit of +7%, and setting a stop loss at -8%.",
