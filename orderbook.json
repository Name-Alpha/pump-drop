Given the moderate volatility and medium volume, entering near market price for an aggressive entry is a good strategy. The take profit range of +10% to +20% balances potential gains with risk management. A stop loss of -10% provides room to breathe in case of sudden price changes.\n\n**Note:** If the momentum were to accelerate or decelerate significantly, the decision might change accordingly.",

The recent trades indicate an uptrend, with 4 buys in the last 5 trades. While the volume is low, we can still consider entering near the market price. However, due to the medium volatility and stable momentum, we'll opt for more conservative parameters.\n\n**Note:** These dynamic trading parameters are specific to the Lumio/SOL token based on the provided data. It's essential to continuously monitor the token's performance and adjust parameters accordingly.",
