      "ai_reasoning": "**Analysis and Decision:**\n\n1. **Volume Ratio (Buys/Sells):**  \n   The provided ratio is **0.8**, which implies **sells are 80% of buys**. This suggests **more buys** than sells. However, the rule states:  \n   - *If more sells than buys (ratio < 1.0): SKIP or WATCH (high risk)*.  \n   - *If balanced (ratio 1.0\u20131.5): WATCH or conservative BUY*.  \n   - *If strong buying (ratio > 1.5): BUY with aggressive parameters*.  \n\n   The ratio **0.8** falls under **more sells than buys**, which would typically trigger a **high-risk** alert. However, this contradicts the recent trades showing **more buys (171 vs. 129)**. This discrepancy may indicate an error in the ratio reporting. Assuming the ratio is **buys/sells = 1.325** (171/129), it falls into the **balanced** category (1.0\u20131.5), suggesting **conservative BUY**.\n\n2. **Momentum and Flow Rate:**  \n   - **Price change** and **flow rate** are not provided, so no additional analysis is possible.  \n\n3. **Final Decision:**  \n   Based on the corrected interpretation of the volume ratio (buys/sells = 1.325), the decision is to **conservatively BUY** with a **balanced** approach.  \n\n**Answer:**  \n**Conservative BUY** (due to balanced buying pressure).  \n\n**Note:** If the ratio is indeed 0.8 (sells/buys), the decision would be **SKIP or WATCH** due to high sell pressure. However, recent trades suggest a stronger buy signal, warranting a **conservative BUY**.",
