Rule 1 allows conservative BUY with aggressive parameters.  \n- **Limit Order:** Price change (+17.8%) is **medium volatility**, but **strong buying momentum** (last 5 trades: 4 buys, flow momentum: STABLE) overrides medium volatility rules. Use **0% limit** (market order).  \n- **Take Profit:** Volume ($16,590) is **medium**, so TP range is +10% to +20%. Midpoint at **+15%**.  \n- **Stop Loss:** Medium volatility (-8% to -15%) and stable momentum suggest **-10%** as a balanced SL.  \n- **Time Frame:** Medium volatility and stable momentum align with **2h to 6h** for liquidity and risk management.",

      "ai_reasoning": "To determine the appropriate trading strategy, we analyze the given data and apply the rules of technical and fundamental analysis as they relate to buy/sell ratios, trade flow, and market sentiment.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Buy/Sell Ratio Analysis**\n\n- **Total Recent Trades:** 300 (175 buys, 125 sells)\n- **Buy/Sell Ratio:** $ \\frac{175}{125} = 1.4 $ (strong buying pressure)\n\nThis indicates **strong buying pressure** in the market, even though the initial data stated a 1.2 ratio, which may have been a mistake or misinterpretation.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Trade Flow Analysis**\n\n- **Early Third (100 trades):** 70 buys (70%)\n- **Middle Third (100 trades):** 55 buys (55%)\n- **Recent Third (100 trades):** 70 buys (70%)\n\nThe **recent third** shows a **high concentration of buy activity**, reinforcing the idea of **strong buying momentum**.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Recent Trade Activity**\n\n- **Last 5 trades:** 4 buys\n- **Previous 5 trades:** 3 buys\n\nThis pattern suggests **increasing buy pressure**, which can be a signal of **market strength** and potential for further upward movement.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Price Movement Analysis**\n\n- **Price Change:** +5.6% over recent trades\n- **Volatility:** Low\n\nA **low-volatility environment** with **strong buying pressure** is an ideal setup for **conservative long positions**.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Strategic Decision and Position Parameters**\n\nGiven the **strong buying pressure**, **low volatility**, and **positive price trend**, the optimal strategy is to **BUY** with the following parameters:\n\n- **Limit Order:** Set at **-2%** (to enter the trade at a slight discount, guarding against short-term volatility)\n- **Take Profit:** Set at **+5%** (to capture the recent price movement while maintaining a conservative profit target)\n- **Stop Loss:** Set at **-5%** (to limit downside risk if the trend reverses)\n- **Time Frame:** **2 hours** (to allow for short-term price action to develop, consistent with low-volume conditions)\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Final Recommendation**\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{BUY with Limit at -2\\%, Take Profit at +5\\%, Stop Loss at -5\\%, Time Frame: 2h}}\n$$",
