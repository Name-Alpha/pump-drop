Additionally, the price change is quite volatile, making it challenging to predict future movements. For now, it's best to skip this opportunity and wait for more favorable conditions.\n\nIf you're interested in taking on higher risk, consider setting a limit order at -5% to -10% below the current price with a take profit of +15% to +20%. However, keep in mind that this is an aggressive approach, and you should be prepared to face potential losses.",
