      "ai_reasoning": "**Analysis and Decision:**\n\nGiven the data and the rules provided, the key factors to consider are:\n\n1. **Buy/Sell Ratio:** The user explicitly states the ratio is **1.4**, which falls within the **balanced** range (1.0\u20131.5). This suggests a cautious approach, as the market is neither strongly bullish nor bearish.\n\n2. **Price Change:** The price has increased by **+140.8%**, indicating **high volatility**. This aligns with Rule 2, which recommends setting a **limit order at -5% to -10%** for high volatility scenarios.\n\n3. **Volume:** The volume is **$10,264**, which is above $10,000. According to Rule 3, this qualifies for a **take profit range of +20% to +40%**.\n\n4. **Momentum:** The **flow momentum is stable**, but recent trades and the trade flow in the **recent third** (74 buys) suggest **strong buying pressure**, which may contradict the stated ratio.\n\n5. **Contradiction in Data:** The actual buy/sell counts (189 buys vs. 111 sells) imply a **ratio of ~1.7**, which would fall under **strong buying**. This discrepancy likely indicates an error in the user's provided ratio.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision:**\n\nDespite the stated ratio of 1.4, the **actual trade data strongly suggests strong buying pressure**. Therefore, the correct approach is to **BUY** with **aggressive parameters** to capitalize on the high volatility and strong buying trend.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Parameters:**\n\n- **Limit Order:** Since the buying pressure is strong, use **0% (market order)** to enter immediately.\n- **Take Profit:** Based on high volume, set take profit at **+20% to +40%**.\n- **Stop Loss:** Given the high volatility, set a **stop loss at -15% to -25%**.\n- **Time Frame:** High volatility suggests a **short-term time frame of 30 minutes to 2 hours**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\n**Buy** the asset with the following parameters:  \n- **Entry:** Market order (0%)  \n- **Take Profit:** +20% to +40%  \n- **Stop Loss:** -15% to -25%  \n- **Time Frame:** 30 minutes to 2 hours  \n\nThis strategy aligns with the strong buying trend and high volatility, even though the stated ratio may have been misreported.",
