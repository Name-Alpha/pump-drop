      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the provided data, I will analyze the token FTX/SOL and provide dynamic trading parameters.\n\n**Momentum Analysis**\n\nThe buy/sell ratio is 2.2, indicating strong buying pressure. The recent trades show a balanced flow with 153 buys out of 300 total trades (51%). However, the last 5 trades indicate 2 buys, which might be a sign of a slight reversal or at least a pause in the buying momentum.\n\n**Volatility Analysis**\n\nThe price change is +16.4%, indicating moderate volatility.\n\n**Trade Flow and Momentum**\n\nThe flow momentum is STABLE, with consistent buying pressure across the three sections of trades (early, middle, and recent). This indicates that the buying trend is stable but not accelerating rapidly.\n\n**Dynamic Trading Parameters**\n\nBased on these analyses, here are the dynamic trading parameters for FTX/SOL:\n\n1. **BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM**: Strong buying pressure with a balanced flow momentum.\n2. **LIMIT ORDER (where to enter)**: Medium volatility (10-50% price change), so I will use -3% to -5%.\n3. **TAKE PROFIT**: Low volume (< $3k), so I will use +5% to +10%.\n4. **STOP LOSS**: Medium volatility, so I will use -8% to -15%.\n5. **TIME FRAME**: Moderate volatility and stable momentum, so I will use 2h to 6h.\n\n**Trade Parameters**\n\nBUY | Limit:-3% | TP:+7% | SL:-12% | Time:4h\n\nI have chosen a limit of -3% to enter the trade near market conditions. The take profit is set at +7%, considering the low volume and moderate volatility. A stop loss of -12% allows for some room to breathe in case of a sudden price drop.\n\n**Decision**: BUY",
