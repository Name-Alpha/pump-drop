Please note that these are specific to this Solana token simulation.\n\n**Token Analysis:**\n\n* Current Price: $0.00001492\n* Volume: $1,254\n* Buy/Sell Ratio: 2.3 (strong buying pressure)\n* Price Change: -17.8% (medium volatility)\n\n**Dynamic Trading Parameters:**\n\nBased on the rules and data analysis:\n\n1. **BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM:**\n\t* Buy/Sell Ratio: 2.3, which indicates strong buying pressure.\n\t* Flow momentum is STABLE.\n\t* Since there's no indication of accelerating or decelerating momentum, we'll consider this as a balanced flow.\n2. **LIMIT ORDER (where to enter):**\n\t* Volume is low ($1,254), so we'll use the \"Low volatility\" parameters.\n\t* However, considering the strong buying pressure and medium price change (-17.8%), we can adjust our entry point slightly more aggressively.\n3. **TAKE PROFIT:**\n\t* Low volume (< $3k), so we'll use the low volume TP range: +5% to +10%.\n4. **STOP LOSS:**\n\t* Medium volatility, so we'll use the medium volatility SL range: -8% to -15%.\n5. **TIME FRAME:**\n\t* Since there's no indication of a strong trend or high volatility, we can use a standard time frame.\n\n**Trading Decision and Parameters:**\n\nBased on these parameters:\n\n* **BUY | Limit:-2% | TP:+7% | SL:-10% | Time:4h**\n\nReasoning:\nWith strong buying pressure and stable flow momentum, it's likely that the price will continue to rise. However, considering the low volume and medium volatility, we'll enter with a slightly more conservative limit order (-2%) and set our take profit at +7%. The stop loss will be -10% to give some room for price movement.\n\nNote: As this is a simulation token with very low liquidity (volume of $1,254), it's essential to keep the position size small and adjust the trading parameters accordingly.",
