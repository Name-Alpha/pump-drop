While recent trade data suggests a bullish bias, the explicitly stated ratio takes precedence.",

      "ai_reasoning": "The analysis of the given data involves several key factors:\n\n1. **Buy/Sell Ratio**: The user specifies a \"Buy/Sell Ratio\" of 0.4. This implies that for every 1 unit of buy activity, there is 0.4 units of sell activity. In standard terms, this ratio is less than 1.0, indicating **more sell activity than buy activity**. This suggests **net selling pressure** in the market.\n\n2. **Price Change**: The price has increased by **+2.4%**, which is a **low-volatility** environment. This would typically be associated with **consolidation or sideways movement**, rather than strong directional momentum.\n\n3. **Volume**: The volume is **$54,580**, which falls into the **medium volume** range ($3,000\u2013$10,000). Medium volume often indicates **moderate interest** in the asset but not strong enough to drive a clear trend.\n\n4. **Trade Flow Momentum**: The trade flow is described as **stable**, which implies no clear acceleration in buying or selling pressure. This aligns with the low-volatility environment and the net sell activity.\n\n5. **Rule Application**:\n   - **Rule 1 (Buy/Sell Ratio)**: A ratio less than 1.0 suggests **net selling pressure**, which generally **does not support a buy decision**.\n   - **Rule 2 (Limit Order)**: Given the low volatility, the limit order range would be **0% to -2%**, but this is **not applicable** in a net-sell environment.\n   - **Rule 3 (Take Profit)**: For medium volume, take profit is **+10% to +20%**, but again, this is **not applicable** if the market is in a net-sell phase.\n   - **Rule 4 (Stop Loss)**: For low volatility, stop loss is **-5% to -8%**, but this would only be relevant if a trade were initiated, which is **not the case** here.\n   - **Rule 5 (Time Frame)**: A stable flow suggests **short to medium-term holding**, but again, this is **not actionable** without a clear buy signal.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The net sell activity, stable flow, and low volatility all point to a **market in consolidation or sideways movement**, with **no strong buy signal**. Therefore, the appropriate action is to **watch the market** for potential shifts in momentum or volume before considering a trade.\n\n**Final Answer**:  \n**WATCH** the market for any changes in momentum or volume before making a decision.",
