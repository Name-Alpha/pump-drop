      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the provided data, I will analyze the Solana token \"tamii\" and provide dynamic trading parameters.\n\n**Token Analysis:**\n\n* Current Price: $0.00009931\n* Volume: $13,434\n* Buy/Sell Ratio: 1.2 (more sells than buys)\n* Price Change: -23.1% (recently declining)\n\n**Dynamic Trading Parameters:**\n\nBased on the rules provided:\n\n1. **BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM:**\n\t* The buy/sell ratio is slightly above 1, indicating more sells than buys, which suggests a potential risk.\n2. **LIMIT ORDER (where to enter):**\n\t* Price Change: -23.1% indicates low volatility (< 10%), so we'll consider the upper limit of the entry range.\n3. **TAKE PROFIT:**\n\t* Volume is $13,434, which falls in the medium volume category ($3k-$10k), suggesting a reasonable liquidity to exit.\n4. **STOP LOSS:**\n\t* Price Change indicates low volatility (< 10%), so we'll consider the upper limit of the stop-loss range.\n5. **TIME FRAME:**\n\t* Low volume and recent price decline suggest a longer time frame.\n\n**Trading Parameters:**\n\nBased on these parameters, I recommend:\n\nBUY | Limit:-1% | TP:+15% | SL:-7% | Time:4h\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe token is experiencing declining prices (-23.1%), which indicates low volatility (< 10%). The buy/sell ratio is slightly above 1, suggesting more sells than buys, but not overwhelmingly so. To minimize risk, I recommend a conservative entry limit of -1%, while targeting a take-profit range of +15% to capitalize on potential upside. A stop-loss at -7% will provide sufficient room to breathe in case the price declines further.\n\n**Risk Considerations:**\n\nWhile this setup is relatively cautious, it's essential to monitor the market and adjust parameters as needed to maintain an optimal risk-reward balance.\n\nPlease note that these parameters are specific to the \"tamii\" token on Solana and may not be applicable to other tokens or markets.",

BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM:**\n\nBuy/Sell Ratio: 1.2\nRecent trades (last 5): 3 buys, indicating a slight increase in buying pressure.\nFlow momentum is STABLE.\n\nGiven these factors, the buying pressure is moderate to low, and momentum is stable.\n\n*If more sells than buys (ratio < 1.0): SKIP or WATCH*\n\n**Ruling:** Not enough strong evidence for strong buying, but stable momentum indicates a standard approach.\n\n**2.
