Therefore, the decision should be **SKIP**.\n\nHowever, I will also analyze the trade flow to determine if there's any momentum or trend.\n\nThe trade flow shows a balanced distribution of buys and sells across all three thirds. The recent trades indicate some buying pressure, but it's not strong enough to overcome the overall sell pressure.\n\nConsidering these factors, the decision is **SKIP** due to the high risk associated with more sells than buys.\n\n**Rule 2: LIMIT ORDER**\n\n* Since there's no indication of strong buying pressure or low volatility, we'll consider medium volatility.\n* The price change is -10.4%, which falls within the medium volatility range (10-50%).\n* Therefore, the limit order will be set at **-3%**.\n\n**Rule 3: TAKE PROFIT**\n\n* Since the volume is relatively low ($2,133), we'll assume it's a low-volume token.\n* Based on this assumption, the take profit will be set at **+5%**.\n\n**Rule 4: STOP LOSS**\n\n* Considering medium volatility and a stable flow momentum, the stop loss will be set at **-8%**.\n\n**Rule 5: TIME FRAME**\n\n* Since there's no indication of high volatility or strong trend, we'll assume a standard time frame.\n* Therefore, the time frame will be set at **2h**.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nWATCH with reason \"High risk due to more sells than buys\"\n\nThe final decision is to WATCH the token due to the high risk associated with more sells than buys. However, if you still want to enter the trade, consider setting a limit order at -3% and adjusting your stop loss to -8%.",

The volume is relatively low, but the price change suggests medium volatility. Taking profit early and setting a tight stop loss will help minimize potential losses.\n\n**Note**: As always, trading involves risk, and it's essential to set stop-loss orders and consider position sizing based on your individual risk tolerance.",
