The recent trades show 4 buys in the last 5 trades, which is a strong indication of momentum. However, the flow momentum is STABLE, not accelerating or decelerating. Considering these factors, I will set aggressive parameters for entry.\n\n**Limit Order:**\nThe price change is +74.3%, indicating high volatility. Therefore, I recommend entering with a limit order at -5% to -10%.\n\n**Take Profit:**\nThe volume is $4,495, which falls into the medium volume category ($3k-$10k). However, considering the strong buying pressure and momentum, I will set a higher take profit target.\n\n**Stop Loss:**\nThe volatility of +74.3% indicates high risk. Therefore, I recommend setting a wider stop loss range to -12% to -18%.\n\n**Time Frame:**\nConsidering the high volatility and strong trend, I recommend a time frame of 4h to 1day.\n\nHere are the dynamic trading parameters for CYBERDENG / SOL:\n\n**Decision:** BUY\n\n**Format:** BUY | Limit:-8.5% | TP:+20% | SL:-15% | Time:6h\n\nThese parameters take into account the balanced buying pressure, strong momentum, high volatility, and medium volume. The limit order is set at -8.5%, which is slightly more conservative than the recommended range due to the recent trades showing 4 buys in a row. The take profit target is set at +20%, considering the strong trend and potential for further price appreciation. The stop loss is set at -15% to -18% to account for the high risk.",
