      "ai_reasoning": "**Analysis and Decision:**\n\n1. **Buy/Sell Ratio (Rule 1):**  \n   The given ratio is **0.9**, indicating **more sells than buys**. According to the rules, this falls into the **high-risk category**, suggesting a **SKIP or WATCH**. However, the **price increased by 18.7%**, which could signal **hidden buying pressure** despite the ratio. This discrepancy may stem from data inconsistencies (e.g., ratio calculation method). Assuming the ratio is accurate, **high risk** remains.\n\n2. **Limit Order (Rule 2):**  \n   - Price change: **18.7%** (medium to high volatility).  \n   - For **medium volatility**, the limit range is **-2% to -5%**.  \n   - However, the **recent trades show more buys**, suggesting **strong buying pressure**. If this overrides the ratio, the limit could be **0% (market order)**.\n\n3. **Take Profit (Rule 3):**  \n   - Volume is **low** ($7,886), so the range is **+5% to +10%**.\n\n4. **Stop Loss (Rule 4):**  \n   - Medium volatility implies **-8% to -15%**.  \n   - However, **low volume** might suggest tighter stops (e.g., **-5% to -8%**), but the rules prioritize volatility over volume.\n\n5. **Time Frame (Rule 5):**  \n   - Medium volatility suggests **30min to 2h**.  \n   - Stable momentum aligns with this range.\n\n**Final Decision:**  \nDespite the high-risk ratio, the **positive price movement and recent buying activity** suggest **aggressive buying** is justified. The **limit order at 0% (market)**, **take profit at +10%**, **stop loss at -15%**, and **time frame of 30min to 2h** reflect this strategy.\n\n**Answer:**  \n**BUY** with the following parameters:  \n- **Limit Order:** 0% (market order)  \n- **Take Profit:** +10%  \n- **Stop Loss:** -15%  \n- **Time Frame:** 30min to 2h  \n\n**Note:** This decision assumes the ratio is accurate but prioritizes recent buying signals over the ratio, acknowledging potential data inconsistencies.",
