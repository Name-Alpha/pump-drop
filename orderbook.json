With low volume, it's essential to enter near the market price without waiting for a dip. A take profit of +15% should be sufficient given the medium volatility, and a stop loss of -7% will provide some room to breathe.\n\nPlease note that these parameters are based on the specific data provided for \"Nya / SOL\" and may not be applicable to other tokens or situations.",
