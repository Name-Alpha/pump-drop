Take profit set at +7% to capitalize on potential gains, and stop loss at -10% to limit losses.\n\nPlease note that these parameters are specific to this token and may not be applicable to other tokens or situations.",

Here are the results:\n\n**Momentum and Pressure Analysis**\n\n* Buy/Sell Ratio: 0.9\n* Flow Momentum: STABLE\n* Recent trades: 2 buys, indicating a slight increase in buying pressure.\n\nGiven these factors, I'll set the parameters as follows:\n\n1. **BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM**\n\t* Since the buy/sell ratio is below 1.0 and momentum is stable, this token may not be worth the risk.\n2. **LIMIT ORDER**\n\t* With a price change of +39.5%, I'd consider this high volatility.\n\t* Therefore, I'll set the limit order to wait for a bigger dip: -7% (near the upper limit of low-volatility entry).\n\n3. **TAKE PROFIT**\n\t* The volume is relatively low ($3,772), so I'll opt for an early take profit.\n\n4. **STOP LOSS**\n\t* With high volatility and low volume, I'll set a tighter stop loss to minimize potential losses.\n\n5. **TIME FRAME**\n\t* Considering the high price change and relatively low volume, I'd recommend a shorter time frame.\n\n**Trading Parameters**\n\nBUY | Limit:-7% | TP:+8% | SL:-12% | Time:1h\n\n**Reasoning**\n\nGiven the stable momentum and buy/sell ratio close to 1.0, I'm cautious about entering this trade with high risk. However, since there's a slight increase in buying pressure and the recent trades show more buys than sells, I'll set conservative parameters for a potential entry.\n\nKeep in mind that these parameters are dynamic and may change based on future data.
