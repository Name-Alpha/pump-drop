However, since the momentum is STABLE, not accelerating or decelerating, we can still consider buying.\n\n2. **LIMIT ORDER**:\n   - The price change is +4.1%, which falls within medium volatility.\n   - Therefore, a limit order of **-2% to -5%** seems appropriate to wait for a slight dip before entering.\n\n3. **TAKE PROFIT**: With a volume of $23,941, this is considered low to medium volume. \n   - **+7% to +12%** (slightly above the middle range) for take profit seems reasonable, balancing between taking advantage of the potential gain and minimizing loss.\n\n4. **STOP LOSS**:\n   - Given the low to medium volatility, a stop loss of **-6% to -10%** is appropriate, providing some room for correction without being overly aggressive.\n\n5. **TIME FRAME**: \n   - With stable momentum and low to medium volume, considering a time frame that allows for at least one hour of trading activity to see the price movement before exiting seems prudent.\n   - Thus, **2h to 4h** would be a suitable time frame.\n\nDecision: **BUY**\n\nFormat:\n- **BUY | Limit:-3% | TP:+9% | SL:-8% | Time:2h**\n\nThis decision is based on balancing risk with potential gain in a stable momentum environment but with a slightly higher sell volume than buy.",

The flow momentum is STABLE, which means we can be more aggressive in our entry.\n\n**Limit Order (where to enter):**\nGiven the strong buying pressure, we will enter with a market order, as suggested by rule 3. Since the price change is moderate (+4.1%), and considering the low volume ($2,883), we can enter near the current market price.\n\n**Take Profit:**\nThe volume is relatively low, so we will take profit early. Based on rule 3, Take Profit for Low Volume (< $3k): +5% to +10%.\n\n**Stop Loss:**\nConsidering the moderate price change and stable momentum, we don't need a very wide stop loss. Based on rule 4, Stop Loss for Medium Volatility (10-50%): -8% to -15%. Since the token has experienced some volatility, let's set our stop loss at the upper end of this range: -12%.\n\n**Time Frame:**\nGiven the stable momentum and moderate price change, we can set a time frame that balances between quick trade and trend following. Based on rule 5, Time Frame for Low Volume (2h to 6h), let's choose a 4-hour time frame.\n\n**Final Parameters:**\n\nBUY | Limit:0% | TP:+7% | SL:-12% | Time:4h\n\nThese parameters are based on the specific data provided for the Baldy token and are adjusted according to the rules.",
