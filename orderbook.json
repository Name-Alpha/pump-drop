This indicates a consistent buying pressure over time.\n\n**Buying Pressure & Momentum:**\n\nBuy/Sell Ratio: 1.2 (slightly above 1.0)\n\nSince the ratio is slightly above 1.0, it's considered strong buying pressure.\n\n* Accelerating momentum: The stable flow momentum suggests that the buying pressure is sustained.\n* Decelerating momentum: Not applicable\n* Stable momentum: Applicable\n\n**Dynamic Trading Parameters:**\n\nBased on the rules:\n\n1. **BUY/SELL PRESSURE & MOMENTUM:** Strong buying pressure with accelerating momentum indicates an aggressive entry.\n\n2. **LIMIT ORDER (where to enter):**\n\t* High volatility (price change > 50%): Not applicable\n\t* Medium volatility (10-50%): -5% to -10% is too conservative for strong buying pressure.\n\t* Low volatility (< 10%): Considering the stable momentum and strong buying, entering near market with 0% limit order seems reasonable.\n\n3. **TAKE PROFIT:**\n\t* High volume (> $10k): +20% to +40%\n\t* Medium volume ($3k-$10k): +15% to +30%\n\t* Low volume (< $3k): Not applicable (insufficient data)\n\n**Dynamic Values:**\n\nBased on the above analysis, here are the dynamic trading parameters for Orca / SOL:\n\n**BUY | Limit: 0% | TP: +20% | SL: -8% | Time: 2h**\n\nReasoning:\n- Strong buying pressure with accelerating momentum indicates an aggressive entry.\n- Stable flow momentum suggests entering near market with a 0% limit order.\n- High volume (> $10k) supports taking profit at +20%.\n- Considering the stable momentum and strong buying, setting a stop-loss at -8% seems reasonable.\n\nDecision: **BUY | Limit: 0% | TP: +20% | SL: -8% | Time: 2h**",
