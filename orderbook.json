Decision: BUY**\n- The **buy/sell ratio is 1.1**, which is slightly above 1.0, indicating a **slight buying pressure**.\n- The **market momentum is stable**, and the **price has moved +3.5%**, which is considered **low volatility**.\n- These conditions support a **conservative buy**.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Limit Order: -2%**\n- The **price change is +3.5%**, which falls under **low volatility**.\n- Rule: For **low volatility**, the **limit order range is 0% to -2%**.\n- Since there's **some buying pressure** (ratio > 1.0), we choose the **lower end of the range** to be more cautious.\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Take Profit (TP): +5%**\n- The **volume is $620**, which is **below $3,000**, so it falls under **low volume**.\n- Rule: For **low volume**, the **TP range is +5% to +10%**.\n- Since the volume is **low**, we take the **lower end of the range** to reflect **early profit-taking**.\n\n---\n\n#### **4. Stop Loss (SL): -5%**\n- Again, **low volume** applies.\n- Rule: For **low volume**, the **SL range is -5% to -8%**.\n- We choose the **lower end** of the range to reflect a **conservative stop loss** in a low-volume environment.\n\n---\n\n#### **5. Time Frame: 2h**\n- The **volume is low**, and the **price movement is modest**, so the **holding period is short**.\n- Rule: For **low volume**, the **time frame is 2h to 6h**.\n- We choose the **lower end** to reflect a **short-term, cautious approach**.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThis setup balances **risk and reward** in a **low-volume, low-volatility** environment, with a **conservative buy** and **short-term holding period**.",

      "ai_reasoning": "To evaluate the trading scenario, we apply the given rules to the provided data and determine the appropriate action and associated parameters.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Buy/Sell Ratio Analysis**\n\nThe **Buy/Sell Ratio** is given as **0.6**, which is **less than 1.0**. According to the rules, this indicates **more sells than buys**, which is a **high-risk condition**.\n\n- **Decision**: **WATCH**  \n  - Because the ratio is below 1.0, the market is favoring sellers, which increases the risk of a potential downturn.\n  - However, the **flow momentum is stable**, and the **recent trades** show some buying activity, so we do not immediately rule out the possibility of a reversal or stabilization.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Volatility and Price Change**\n\n- **Price change**: **+86.9%**  \n  - This is a **high volatility** event, indicating significant price movement and possible instability.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Volume Consideration**\n\n- **Trading volume**: **$2,588**  \n  - This is **below the $3,000 threshold**, indicating **low volume**, which may suggest a lack of strong market conviction.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Parameter Calculation Based on Rules**\n\nUsing the provided rules, we derive the following parameters:\n\n#### **Limit Order (Stop Loss or Entry Range)**\n- **High volatility** \u2192 **-15% to -25%**\n  - This is the **stop-loss range** or the range within which we would consider entering a trade.\n\n#### **Take Profit (TP)**\n- **Low volume** \u2192 **+5% to +10%**\n  - This is the **target profit range** for a trade.\n\n#### **Time Frame**\n- **High volatility** \u2192 **30 minutes to 2 hours**\n  - This is the **time window** for monitoring and executing a trade.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Decision and Parameters**\n\nGiven the **Buy/Sell Ratio < 1.0**, the **high volatility**, and **low volume**, the market is currently in a **high-risk, unstable condition**. However, the **stable flow momentum** and **recent buying activity** suggest there may be a chance for stabilization or a reversal.\n\nThus, the appropriate decision is to:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\text{WATCH (Buy/Sell Ratio < 1.0, high risk; stable flow momentum, recent buying activity)}}\n$$\n\nAnd the associated parameters are:\n\n- **Limit Order**: -15% to -25%\n- **Take Profit**: +5% to +10%\n- **Time Frame**: 30 minutes to 2 hours",
