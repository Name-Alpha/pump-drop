      "ai_reasoning": "### Analysis and Decision\n\n#### 1. **Buy/Sell Ratio (1.4)**\nThe ratio of 1.4 indicates a **balanced market**, as it is **above 1.0** but **below the threshold for strong buying** (1.5). This means that while there is a slight buying bias, it is not strong enough to justify a full BUY decision. According to Rule 1, the decision would lean toward **WATCH** or **conservative BUY**.\n\n#### 2. **Price Change (+174.3%)**\nThis is a **high-volatility** situation. The massive price movement suggests potential for both rapid gains and sharp declines. Rule 2 advises a **limit order** at **-5% to -10%**, to wait for a pullback before entering.\n\n#### 3. **Volume ($32,605)**\nThe volume is above $10,000, which qualifies for **high-volume** conditions. Rule 3 recommends a **take profit range of +20% to +40%**, reflecting the liquidity and potential for further price movement.\n\n#### 4. **Stop Loss (High Volatility)**\nGiven the high volatility, Rule 4 suggests a **stop loss of -15% to -25%**, to protect against a sudden reversal.\n\n#### 5. **Time Frame (High Volatility)**\nRule 5 advises a **short-term time frame** of **30 minutes to 2 hours**, suitable for high-volatility environments where rapid decision-making is key.\n\n---\n\n### Final Decision\n\nDespite the **recent trades and flow** suggesting a **buying bias**, the **Buy/Sell ratio of 1.4** (balanced) and **high volatility** make a **conservative approach** more prudent. Therefore, the **best decision is to WATCH** the market for further signs of a stronger buying trend before committing.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n**Decision:** WATCH  \n**Limit Order:** -5% to -10%  \n**Take Profit:** +20% to +40%  \n**Stop Loss:** -15% to -25%  \n**Time Frame:** 30 minutes to 2 hours",
