This is a high-risk situation, but we can be aggressive.\n2. **LIMIT ORDER (where to enter):**\n\t* Low volatility (< 10% price change). Given the strong buying pressure, it's best to enter near market.\n3. **TAKE PROFIT:**\n\t* Low volume (< $3k). To take profit early and avoid holding onto potentially volatile trades.\n4. **STOP LOSS:**\n\t* Medium volatility (-8% to -15%). This allows for some room to breathe while still being cautious.\n5. **TIME FRAME:**\n\t* Low volume (2h to 6h). This time frame is suitable given the low volume and accelerating momentum.\n\n**Trading Parameters:**\n\nBUY | Limit:0% | TP:+10% | SL:-12% | Time:3h\n\nThe reasoning behind these parameters is:\n\n* Enter near market with a limit order, as there's strong buying pressure.\n* Set a take profit of +10% to capitalize on the potential increase while taking profits early due to low volume.\n* Use a stop loss of -12%, which falls within the medium volatility range, providing some room for the trade to breathe.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\nBUY | Limit:0% | TP:+10% | SL:-12% | Time:3h",
