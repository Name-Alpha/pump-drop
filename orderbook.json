However, recent strong buying indicates slight deviation towards aggressive entry.\n2. **LIMIT ORDER (where to enter):**\n\t* Price Change is 25%, indicating medium volatility. With strong buying pressure and stable momentum, it's best not to wait for a bigger dip.\n\n3. **TAKE PROFIT:**\n\t* Volume ($101,396) indicates high volume. This warrants more aggressive take profit parameters.\n\n4. **STOP LOSS:**\n\t* Medium volatility (-8% to -15%) is suitable given the price change of 25%.\n\n5. **TIME FRAME:**\n\t* With medium volatility and strong buying pressure, a standard time frame seems appropriate.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nGiven these dynamic parameters:\n\nBUY | Limit:0% | TP:+20% | SL:-12% | Time:2h\n\nThe decision is based on the token's current momentum, price action, and volume.

The recent trades show 1 buy and 0 sells in the last 5 trades, indicating a potential reversal.\n\n**Limit:** 0% (enter near market)\n\n**Take Profit (TP):**\nGiven the low volume of $10,307, we will aim for a moderate take profit.
