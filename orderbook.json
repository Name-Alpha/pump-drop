      "ai_reasoning": "**Analysis and Decision:**\n\n1. **Buy/Sell Ratio (Rule 1):**  \n   The provided \"buy/sell ratio\" is **0.9**, which is **less than 1.0**, indicating **more sells than buys**. According to Rule 1, this falls into the **high-risk category**, suggesting a **WATCH or SKIP** decision. However, the recent trades (161 buys vs. 139 sells) and stable flow momentum contradict this, implying **strong buying pressure**. This ambiguity may stem from unclear ratio definitions (e.g., buys/sells vs. sells/buys). Assuming the ratio is **buys/sells**, 0.9 means **more sells**, but recent data shows **more buys**, creating inconsistency. \n\n2. **Price Change (Rule 2):**  \n   A **+21.3%** price increase indicates **medium to high volatility**. Rule 2 recommends a **limit order of -2% to -5%** for medium volatility.\n\n3. **Volume (Rule 3):**  \n   Volume is **$5,359**, which is **medium** (between $3k and $10k). Rule 3 suggests a **take profit range of +10% to +20%**.\n\n4. **Stop Loss (Rule 4):**  \n   For **medium volatility**, Rule 4 recommends a **stop loss of -8% to -15%**.\n\n5. **Time Frame (Rule 5):**  \n   Medium volatility aligns with a **4-hour to 1-day** time frame.\n\n**Final Decision:**  \nDespite the ambiguous ratio definition, the **recent trades and flow momentum** strongly suggest **strong buying pressure**. If the ratio is interpreted as **sells/buys** (0.9), it implies **more buys**, which would fall into the **BUY** category (ratio > 1.0). Given this, the **recommended action is to BUY**. \n\n**Answer:**  \n**BUY** with the following parameters:  \n- **Limit Order:** -2% to -5%  \n- **Take Profit:** +10% to +20%  \n- **Stop Loss:** -8% to -15%  \n- **Time Frame:** 4 hours to 1 day  \n\n**Note:** The decision hinges on interpreting the ratio as **sells/buys**, which would place the ratio above 1.0, aligning with strong buying pressure. If the ratio is strictly **buys/sells**, the decision would be **WATCH or SKIP**, but the context of recent trades and flow momentum justifies a **BUY**.",
