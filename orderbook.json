      "ai_reasoning": "**Analysis and Decision:**\n\n1. **Buy/Sell Ratio:**  \n   The user provided a **Buy/Sell Ratio of 0.4**, which implies **more sells than buys** (since 0.4 < 1.0). According to **Rule 1**, this indicates **high risk**, and the recommendation is to **SKIP or WATCH**.  \n\n2. **Price Change and Volatility:**  \n   - The **price increased by 2.8%**, which is **low volatility** (<10%).  \n   - **Rule 2 (Limit Order):** For low volatility, the limit range is **0% to -2%**.  \n\n3. **Volume and Take Profit:**  \n   - **Volume is $4,302**, which is **low**.  \n   - **Rule 3 (Take Profit):** For low volume, the target is **+5% to +10%**.  \n\n4. **Stop Loss and Time Frame:**  \n   - **Rule 4 (Stop Loss):** For low volatility, the stop loss is **-5% to -8%**.  \n   - **Rule 5 (Time Frame):** For low volume, the time frame is **2 to 6 hours**.  \n\n5. **Trade Flow Momentum:**  \n   - The **Trade Flow Momentum is STABLE**, so standard parameters apply. However, the **Buy/Sell Ratio** still indicates **more sells**, which overrides the stability.  \n\n6. **Recent Trades:**  \n   - The **last 5 trades** had **4 buys**, and the **previous 5** had **2 buys**. This suggests **some buying pressure**, but the overall ratio remains **0.4 (buys/sells)**, which still favors **sells**.  \n\n---\n\n**Final Decision:**  \n**WATCH**  \n- **Limit Order:** 0% to -2%  \n- **Take Profit:** +5% to +10%  \n- **Stop Loss:** -5% to -8%  \n- **Time Frame:** 2 to 6 hours  \n\n**Rationale:**  \nWhile recent trades show some buying, the **Buy/Sell Ratio of 0.4** indicates **more sells**, leading to a **high-risk scenario**. The price increase and low volatility suggest potential for a rebound, but the overall imbalance in trades warrants caution. The decision to **WATCH** balances the risk and opportunity.  \n\n**Answer:**  \n**WATCH** with the following parameters:  \n- **Limit Order:** 0% to -2%  \n- **Take Profit:** +5% to +10%  \n- **Stop Loss:** -5% to -8%  \n- **Time Frame:** 2 to 6 hours",
