      "ai_reasoning": "Based on the provided data and dynamic trading parameters, I'll analyze Punch2030/SOL token:\n\n1. **Buy/Sell Ratio**: 2.0\n   - Strong buying pressure, which indicates a potential upward trend.\n\n2. **Flow Momentum**: STABLE (but leaning towards BUY)\n   - Stable momentum suggests that traders are maintaining their positions rather than aggressively selling or buying, which could be an indication of a longer-term bullish stance.\n\n3. **Price Change**: -31.1%\n   - This significant drop in price might indicate overbought conditions or incorrect market pricing.\n\n4. **Volume**: $16,649\n   - The volume is relatively low compared to other cryptocurrencies, indicating less liquidity and potentially higher risk for traders.\n\n**Trading Parameters**\n\n- **LIMIT ORDER**: Given the strong buying pressure (Buy/Sell Ratio > 1.5) and stable momentum, we'll prioritize entering the market with a standard limit order.\n  \n- **TAKE PROFIT**:\n  - Given the low volume, we should take profits early to minimize exposure in case of any unexpected price movements.\n\n- **STOP LOSS**: Given the significant drop in price (-31.1%), it's essential to have some room for correction before deciding on an entry point.\n\nConsidering these parameters:\n\n*   LIMIT ORDER: **0%** (enter near market, strong buying pressure)\n*   TAKE PROFIT: **+5% to +10%** (take profit early due to low volume and recent price drop)\n*   STOP LOSS: **-8% to -12%** (provide some room for correction after the significant price drop)\n\nBased on these parameters:\n\nDecision: **BUY | Limit:0% | TP:+7% | SL:-9% | Time:2h**\n\nExplanation: We'll enter near market, expecting an upward trend due to strong buying pressure and stable momentum. With low volume, we aim for a smaller profit margin while providing some room for price correction in case of unexpected events. The 2-hour time frame allows us to quickly adjust our strategy if the market changes rapidly.",
