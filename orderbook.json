The limit order of -2% will allow for some wiggle room in case the price drops slightly before taking off again. The take profit of +17% reflects the medium volume and strong buying pressure, while the stop loss of -9% is a standard value given the stable momentum.\n\nNote: Please keep in mind that these parameters are dynamic and based on specific data points. It's essential to monitor market conditions and adjust trading parameters accordingly.",
